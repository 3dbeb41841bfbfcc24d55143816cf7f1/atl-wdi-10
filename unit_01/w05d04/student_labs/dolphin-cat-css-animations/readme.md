# DolphinCat!

## Walk like an egyptian (cat)

Oh no! Snuggles the cat is frozen in the bottom left corner. Help him out by
using CSS animations to make him walk across the screen.

When he gets to the end, he should just reappear at the beginning and repeat
his walking pattern.

## Bonuses

### MoonWalk!

Make snuggles the cat walk backwards to the left when he reaches the end.

### Pacer!

Make snuggles walk back to the left when he reaches the end, but instead, make
sure he's facing the direction in which he's walking.

### BEFFIES!

Help Snuggles the Cat and Dewey the Dolphin become BFFs!

Give Snuggles special powers, so that he walks up and over, meeting Dewey the Dolphin
near the middle of the screen.

Make sure he's facing the direction that he's walking.

When Snuggles reaches Dewey, have him celebrate by doing a dance!

Tips:
  * You may want to look into css transform properties for rotation...

### Larry Bird (a cat's favorite prey)

Make Snuggles the cat bounce across the screen like a basketball.
