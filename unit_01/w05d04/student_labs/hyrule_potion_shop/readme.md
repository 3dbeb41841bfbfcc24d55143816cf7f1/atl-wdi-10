# Hyrule Potion Shop

All the flexbox properties have been removed from `holygrail.css`. Fill in the blanks to make the website look nice and responsive again!

(`styles.css` contains all the styling not relevant to flexbox. Feel free to look at it, but don't modify it!)

It should follow the concept of the [Holy Grail layout](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/3760/HolyGrailLayout.png).

What we mean by "filling in the blanks" is taking this:

```css
div{
  /*background-color:*/
}
```

...and turning it into this:

```css
div{
  background-color:blue;
}
```

Feel free to take a look at our solution at the link below -- but only peek at the CSS if you're really stuck!
