# Homework : CSS Animations + Flexbox

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-...` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

#### Exercise Objectives

- create CSS animations using transform, translate, and keyframes
- gain meaningful experience using `flexbox`

#### Directions

1.  In `style.css` write CSS in their appropriate spots to turn your HTML into life using your knowledge of CSS animations. Most of the styling is provided for you already, you'll just have to animation code to it.

2. You will *not* be modifying neither the HTML in the html files nor  `main.css`.

3. After completing each spec, make a commit with the message being the spec itself.

#### Specifications:
  1. Funky Squares: Over 3 second intervals, all funky squares will automatically rotate 180 degrees, for an infinite amount of time.
  2. Sonic: Hovering your mouse over Sonic makes Sonic move across the screen over 2 seconds with a slow start.
  3. Zen: The window will automatically changes colors over a 30 second time period. Every 10% of the time, the color will change with a slow start and end. You can choose any colors you'd like.
  4. Flexbox: Create a 3x3 grid using `flexbox` that is centered in the page.

#### Reach Goals - CSS FUNimations!

- Using only CSS:
  - Funky squares shrink to half their size on hover
  - Hovering over a Dog in Vest image turns that image upside down
  - Sonic rotates 360 degrees as he zooms across the page

- Using jQuery:
  - `<h1>` tags will fade out into nothing over 3 seconds when clicked
  - Clicking on a funky square turns it into a triangle

## Submitting Your Work

  The issue should include:
