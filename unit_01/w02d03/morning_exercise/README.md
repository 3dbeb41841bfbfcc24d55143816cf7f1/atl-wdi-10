# Exercise : Building Layouts from Sketches

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-...` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

## Instructions

Using what you've learned this week about implementing layout with CSS,
try to roughly replicate the layout pictured below in the code files provided.
It's not necessary to add any actual content to the page so long as the
dimensions are reasonable, but you should also feel free to use 'lorem ipsum'
text and/or dummy images.

### Reach Targets

> NOTE: Do not attempt until requirements have been met.

1.  When any one of the four subsections of the main content pane is hovered
    over, it should expand either horizontally (top three) or vertically
    (bottom), without the content pane itself getting any larger.

2.  Make this site responsive using media queries.
    As the page gets smaller (< 850 px), the left sidebar should disappear
    and the main section should grow to take its place (90% width, with 5%
    margin on either side).
    Add any other responsive behavior that you like.
