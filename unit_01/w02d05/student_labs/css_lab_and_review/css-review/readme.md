# CSS Crash Course

## Instructions

Provided are a bunch of `.md` files, and a bunch of `.css` files.

The `.css` files contain a bunch of CSS snippets. The `.md` files contain English descriptions of what all those CSS snippets do -- but in a different order.

Your job is to copy each CSS snippet and paste it next to its description in one of the `.md` files.

For example:

A CSS snippet:
```
background-color:red;
```

An `.md` file:
```
Gives el a red background
` ` `
.el{

}
` ` `
```

...and the solution in the `.md` file:
```
Gives el a red background
` ` `
.el{
  background-color:red;
}
` ` `
```

## To solve this...

First, look at the words used in the CSS snippets. What do the words mean in English? For instance, if you see `background-color:red`, it's pretty obvious what that does.

If you're not sure about a particular snippet, put it in the provided `index.html` and see how its appearance is affected.

1. Open the provided `index.html` file in your web browser. (Drag and drop the file onto the icon of a web browser on your computer.)
2. Copy and paste the snippet into the section marked `PUT YOUR CSS HERE`.
3. "Save" the `index.html` file.
4. "Refresh" the page in your browser to see what changes have been applied.

If you're still unsure, try Googling the name of the CSS property in question (e.g. "CSS background-color").

## What is "el"?

"El" is short for "element". Often, "el" is used in Javascript to refer to a certain element. In this case, when you're told to "do something with el," it means "do something with all elements with the class of 'el'".

## Hint

If you've copied and pasted some strange CSS and refreshed the page, but it doesn't look any different, the CSS may only affect its appearance when the screen or particular elements are bigger or smaller than a certain size.
