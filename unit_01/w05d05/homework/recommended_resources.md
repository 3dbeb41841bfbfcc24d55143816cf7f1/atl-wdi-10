# Intro to the Internet
## Recommended Resources

Web developers are programmers who code programs and applications for ... you guessed it, the World Wide Web. You've already gained experience with Front End development (also known as client-side development) by using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

As we move into server-side development (or "back-end development") in Unit 2 with Node.js, you will learn that the back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database, which we will cover.

Back-end, front-end, full-stack... that's all *great*, but there are questions still standing:

## "What IS the internet? What IS Node? What does Javascript have to do with all this?"

We've compiled a list of videos and articles for you to introduce you to the world of back-end development.

### HTTP
[Part 1 here](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) & [Part 2 here](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

- "The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know" HTTP. You've seen it and use it daily. But what IS IT? Here's a two part web tutorial on HTTP through the lens of a web developer:


[Youtube: Web Apps + the HTTP Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eesqK59rhGA)

- This video visually breaks down what a web application is, and what HTTP has to do with it. Concepts covered include "request/response cycle" and "URL".


### Javascript
[Youtube: What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

- A close look into the "inner workings" of Javascript. This video goes deep into visualizing computer-science concepts/terminology as it pertains to Javascript like “event-loop”, “non-blocking”, “callback”, "call stack", “asynchronous”, “single-threaded” and “concurrency”.

### Node.js
[Youtube: Intro to Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJmFG4ffJZU)

- We'll spend half of our course building web apps with Node.js. This video provides a quick introduction to concepts such as "blocking," "non-blocking," "evented-programming," and "event loops."
