## Start with the traffic_light directory

This is a pattern recognition / debugging exercise. Coding and debugging is partially about knowing what you're doing. But it's also about pattern recognition and mimicry!

1. Load index.html into Chrome.

2. Take a couple minutes to look at the JS and the HTML to familiarize yourself with the functions and naming conventions being used.

3. Start testing. Click the first light on the traffic light.
    - Isolate the JS function that was triggered and add comments about what each line is doing

4. Click the second light.
    - Do you notice something that you didn't expect or that you might consider a bug?
    - What is the bug?
    - After isolating the bug. Squash it!

5. Click the second light and then the first light
  - Do you notice something that you didn't expect or that you might consider a bug?
  - What is the bug?
  - After isolating the bug. Squash it!

6. Click the third light.
    - What do you notice now?
    - Is it a bug or just not complete?
    - Based on your exploration of the code for the prior lights can you fix the traffic light so it works?
