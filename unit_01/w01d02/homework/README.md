# Morning Exercise : JS Basics Practices

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `atl-wdi-9` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

As you work through this assignment, you should make commits regularly, so that
you don't accidentally lose your work.

## Instructions

Read through `classwork.js` and follow all of the directions given there.
