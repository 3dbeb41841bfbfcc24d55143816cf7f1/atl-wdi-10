###Suggested elements/ids/classes to include

These are some ideas for divs you might want to include in your page structure -- the names aren't super important (you can change them if you'd like), but might be helpful for indicating what each div does/where it goes.

``` 
#wrapper 
#container 

<header> 
<nav>

#main-content 
#social-media 

.photobanner 
.imageshadow

#blurb 

#home-boxes 
    .home-box
    .home-box
    .home-box

<footer> 
    .box-footer 
         .blogroll
    .box-footer 
         .textwidget 

#copyright 
#companybottom
```
