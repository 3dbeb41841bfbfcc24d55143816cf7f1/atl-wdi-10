# HTML5 Boilerplate

## Background:

[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) was created by Paul Irish and Divya Manian and is an open source project that is perfect for creating HTML ready cross-browser sites that work with older browsers, including IE.

A tool known as [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) is included in order to allow you to style the new HTML5 elements in IE and helps with detecting HTML5 or CSS3 features in all browsers, including earlier versions of IE (before v9).

## So what is HTML5 Boilerplate?

_HTML5 Boilerplate_ is a front-end kickstart template that contains a series of best practices and common inclusions. It offers a generic files/folders structure, HTML5-ready template and basic server-side global configurations. It’s like a blueprint for your house, but without the building blocks. You have the idea what you’re going to build and you have made all preparation steps, but you don’t have the materials needed to actually build the house. You are free to include “the missing” HTML/CSS/JavaScript components from anywhere else, including from Bootstrap.

To be clear, HTML5 Boilerplate is **not a framework**. It's a template that can be modified and used for your own projects. You can use as much or as little as you want and make your own additions and subtractions. Still, it's one of the most robust and well-commented starting points we've seen for setting up a solid HTML5 base for your projects.

## Features of HTML5 Boilerplate

At first glance Boilerplate may seem like a simple template, but in fact it gives you many benefits that can’t be seen immediately. Let’s check out some of them:

* HTML5-ready template plus basic structure for your files and folders
* Ready-to-use, performance optimized print styles
* Cross-browser compatibility
* Mobile browser optimizations
* Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
* Best-practice server configurations
* Optimal caching and compression rules
* Optimized Google Analytics snippet code
* and more…

You get all these goodies by default, without need of writing a single line of code. And here is the content of the default download:

* `css` – a directory containing normalize.css, and main.css with Boilerplate’s defaults, common helpers, media queries, and print styles.
* `doc` – a directory containing all Boilerplate’s documentation. You can use it as the location for your own project’s documentation.
* `img` – an empty folder for your images
* `js` – a directory containing main.js for your custom code and plugins.js containing the code for all your plugins. Also there are Modernizr and jQuery libraries placed in vendor subfolder.
* `.htaccess` – default web server configurations for Apache. For other servers there is Server Configsrepository.
* `404.html` – a very basic error page
* apple touch icons
* `crossdomain.xml` – a template for working with cross-domain requests.
* `favicon.ico`
* humans.txt – a file to include credits for you and your project.
* index.html – default HTML5-ready template, the base of all pages on your web site.
* robots.txt – a file to include any pages you want to be hidden from search engines.

From this point on, you can start building your web site just by adding your own code and the components you have chosen to use in your project.
