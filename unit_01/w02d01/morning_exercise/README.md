# Homework Review

## Pair Review (25 min)

Pair with a random partner and compare your answers to the homework. Try to come
to an agreement about which answers are right _and_ why they're right.

## Pair Review with Solutions (15 min)

In the same groups as before, read through the posted
[solution](../../w01d05/homework/router-solution.js)
and discuss it. In particular, spend time talking about how to solve similar
problems in the future. Take note of any parts that neither of you understand
very well.

## Class Discussion of Solutions (15 min)

As a class, we will work through the assignment together; each pair will be
tasked with explaining a piece of the answers.

## General Q & A (5 min)

Any remaining questions about the homework can get addressed now.
