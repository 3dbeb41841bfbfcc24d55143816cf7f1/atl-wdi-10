# Prep : HTML and CSS Layout

One of the best CSS tutorials out there is from a web development shop called
called [bocoup](https://bocoup.com).
Their [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com)
tutorial focuses on fundamentals of CSS, something we want to focus on early to
improve our development speed and understanding of CSS for later projects.

The tutorial is made of short sections that each focus on one specific aspect of
layout with CSS. This makes it not only a great tutorial for layout, but also a
valuable reference for later.

This tutorial should take you between 45 minutes and one hour.
