# Week 1 Diagnostic

<!-- MATERIALS METADATA -->
<!--
  title: Week 1 Diagnostic
  format: diagnostic
  original author: Matt Brendzel
  tags: terminal, git, javascript, control flow
-->

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-matey` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

Next, navigate to the directory for today, go into the `diagnostic` directory,
and run `npm install` -- this will download any assignment-specific JavaScript
dependencies into to a directory called `node_modules`.

## Instructions

Read through `diagnostic.js` and complete all of the functions listed there.

### Testing Your Work

A set of automated [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) tests have been
provided for you. You can run these tests by running `npm test` from within the
`diagnostic` directory.

Test your work regularly, and read the feedback from the tests
carefully; they may give you a clue about what to do next, or where your code
may be breaking.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your work,

1.  Run the command `npm test` and take a screenshot of the output in your
    terminal.
2.  Push your code to your fork of the class repo.
3.  File an issue on the class repo titled "Your Name -- w01 Diagnostic".

The issue should include:

-   A link that points back to your fork.

-   The screenshot you took.

-   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very
    uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
