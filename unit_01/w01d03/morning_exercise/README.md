# Homework Review

## Pair Review (10 min)

Pair with a random partner and compare your answers to the homework. Try to come
to an agreement about which answers are right _and_ why they're right.

## Pair Review with Solutions (10 min)

In the same groups as before, read through the posted solutions and discuss
them. In particular, spend time talking about how to solve similar problems in
the future. Take note of any answers that neither of you understand very well.

## Class Discussion of Solutions (25 min)

As a class, we will work through the assignment together; each pair will be
tasked with explaining a piece of the answers.

## General Q & A (5 min)

Any remaining questions about the homework can get addressed now.
