# Homework : Intro to App Building

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-matey` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

Next, navigate to the directory for today, go into the `homework` directory, and
run `npm install` -- this will download any assignment-specific JavaScript
dependencies into a directory called `node_modules`.

As you work through this assignment, you should make commits regularly.

## Instructions

Read through `hw.md` and follow the directions there.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your work, have one person from each pair do the following:

1.  Push your code to your fork of the class repo.
2.  File an issue on the class repo titled "Your Name -- w01d05".

The issue should include:

-   A link that points back to your fork.

-   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very
    uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
