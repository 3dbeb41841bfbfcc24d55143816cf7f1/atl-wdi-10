# Documentation Treasure Hunt

Today's we're going to be hunting for information in the Mozilla Developer
Network's [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
For this exercise, we'd like you to _only_ use the MDN -- that way, you get
very comfortable looking things up there.

Each clue below has a certain number of points associated with finding the
correct answer. If you're not sure, take a guess, since you won't lose points
if you're wrong.

Ready.... Set..... Go!!!

## 1 Point Each

-   What method would turn "a few words" into `["a", "few", "words"]`?

-   What property of an array tells you how many elements are inside it?

-   What method could you call to get the current time?

-   Which type of statement evaluates an expression, matches the expression's
    value to a particular case, and executes code associated with that case?

-   What new JavaScript feature allows you to set read-only constants in
    your code?

-   What method can you call to get a list of all of the properties on an
    object?

## 2 Points Each

-   What Array method plugs every element in the array into a function, one at
    a time, and returns a new array containing the results?

-   What method could we call to generate a random number between 0
    (inclusive) and 9 (exclusive)?

-   What method can you call to fill all of the elements of an array with the
    same constant value?

## 3 Points or More

-   (Up to 3 pts) What method(s) would allow you to extract the string 'rag'
    from the string 'enrage'? 1 pt for each method.

-   (3 pts) What type of Object represents a pattern of text that you can
    search for inside a String?

-   (4 pts) Suppose that we wanted to run some code that we thought might hit an
    error -- for instance, trying to contact a server, and getting no response.
    What group of statements would allow us to try out some code, and if it
    errors out, recover by running some other code?

-   (5 pts) What method iterates through an array one element at a time and
    calls a function, passing in as arguments
    (a) the current element, and
    (b) the function's previous result
    ?

-   (5 pts) What type of Object is used to represent (and stand in for) the
    output of an operation that hasn't finished running?
