# Express - The Router

## Lesson Objectives
1. Describe the DRY principle
2. Describe the Single Responsibility Principle
3. MVC
4. Use the express Router to:
  - Bring the C of MVC
  - Dry up our routes
  - Apply Single Responsibility to our application, specifically to our main server file (server.js)
5. Describe and apply the principles of Refactoring

## DRY and Code Smells

**Don't Repeat Yourself**

The **DRY** principle is aimed at reducing repetition within your code.

> "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

<br />

## Single Responsibility

> "Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle

<br />

## MVC

**Model, View Controller***

**MVC** is an application architectural pattern. So far we have been writing everything in the server file, the views directory, and our data file.

You can imagine that each of these pieces will get larger and larger.    

<br />

## Use the Express Router to Simplify server.js

You may find that your server.js file is growing into a giant file with tons of routes.  Related routes can be grouped together in separate files

```javascript
app.get('/todos', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

app.get('/todos/:id', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

app.get('/todos/:id/edit', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});
```

These routes are all related to todos.  Let's put them in a separate "controller" file and directory.  To do this, let's create a "controllers" directory and create a file called todos_controller.js.  This will be our todos controller file.

Now move the routes pertaining to todos into that todos_controller.js file.

```javascript
app.get('/todos', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

app.get('/todos/:id', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

app.get('/todos/:id/edit', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});
```

Require express at the top of that todos_controller.js file

```javascript
var express = require('express');
```

invoke the router

```javascript
var router = express.Router();
```

Change app to router

```javascript
router.get('/todos', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

router.get('/todos/:id', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

router.get('/todos/:id/edit', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});
```

At the bottom of the file, export the router

```javascript
module.exports = router;
```

Now in your `server.js`, require the controller file we created.  **Be sure to include ./ at the beginning of the path to the controller, so node knows that this is not an NPM package.**

```javascript
var todosController = require('./controllers/todos_controller.js');
```

Use the controller for all routes that start with `/todos`

```javascript
app.use('/todos', todosController);
```

Since we are specifying that the controller will be used for all routes starting with `/todos`, we don't need to show `/todos` in our actual routes within our controller file.

```javascript
router.get('/', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

router.get('/:id', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});

router.get('/:id/edit', function(req, res){
    //do stuff
});
```

## Refactoring

>noun: a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior

> verb: to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior

From: _www.refactoring.com_

>Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity [...]

We're going to refactor the hello app from yesterday so that each of the routes exists in a separate router.
