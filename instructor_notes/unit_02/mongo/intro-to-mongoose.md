## Opening Framing (10 minutes / 0:10)

Before we dive into Mongoose, let's talk a bit about about Mongo/NoSQL.

#### What is a NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database is a non-relational database.

* This means that there is not an explicit one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationship.
* That being said, we can emulate these relationships in a NoSQL database.

#### How is a NoSQL database organized?

A NoSQL database are organized into **documents** and **collections**.

* Collections are the NoSQL equivalent of tables in a SQL database.
* Documents are the NoSQL equivalent of a table row.

> This is not the only way that a NoSQL database organizes data. Check out this [link](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-nosql-databases/) to learn more.

#### What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores information as JSON.

* Technically, it's BJSON or "binary JSON," pronounced "BSON". We will discuss [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) more in a few minutes.

#### Why use NoSQL/MongoDB over SQL?

It is flexible.

* You don't need to follow a schema if you don't want to. This might be helpful with non-uniform data. 
* That being said, you can enforce consistency in your data by using schemas. In fact, we will be doing that in today's class.  And I recommend that you follow this same work-flow.

It is fast.

* Data is "denormalized" in NoSQL, which means that it is all in the same place.
* For example, a post's comments will be nested directly within that post, in the database.
* This is the opposite of a relational database, in which we need to make queries in order to retrieve data in other tables.  The tables are connected through a relation.

Many web applications already implement object-oriented Javascript.

* If we are using objects in both the back-end and front-end, it makes handling and sending data between the client and the database much easier.
* There is no need for type conversion (e.g., making sure a Ruby hash is being served as JSON).

#### What are some example MongoDB commands?

Even though you won't be writing very many MongoDB commands in WDI, we will use some MongoDB CLI commands to test what is in our database. Examples include...

* `show dbs` - Will show a list of all databases
* `use database-name` - Will connect to a database
* `show collections` - Will list the collections that exist within a database
* `db.students.find()` - Will list all of the students in the student collection


#### Data Format

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZAQOhhY.png)

- A MongoDB database consists of _collections_ of _documents_.
- A _document_ in MongoDB is composed of _field_ (key) and _value_ pairs.

Lets take a look of what a MongoDB _document_ may look like:

```js
{
    _id: ObjectId("5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"),
    name: { first: "Alan", last: "Turing" },
    birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),
    death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),
    contribs: [ "Turing machine", "Turing test", "Turingery" ],
    views: 1250000
}
```

Who is [Alan Turing](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/8-things-didnt-know-alan-turing/)?

__What does this data structure remind you of?__ JSON!

A MongoDB _document_ is very much like JSON, except that it is stored in the database, in a format known as _BSON_ (think _Binary JSON_).

_BSON_ basically extends _JSON_ with additional data types, such as __ObjectID__ and the __Date__ shown above.

#### The Document *_id*

The *_id* is a special field that represents the document's _primary key_ and will always be listed as the first field. It must be unique.  Primary keys will become very important in relational/SQL databases, and also when we discuss embedded documents.

We can explicitly set the *_id* like this:

```js
{
  _id: 2,
  name: "Suzy"
}
```
or this...

```js
{
  _id: "ABC",
  name: "Suzy"
}
```
However, it is more common to allow MongoDB to create it implicitly for us, using it's _ObjectID_ data type.

<br />

## Mongoose (5 minutes / 0:15)

![mongoose.js](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/KDQZV88GTIaQn6p0GagE)

> "Let's face it, writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag. That's why we wrote Mongoose."

**Mongoose** is an ODM (Object Data Mapping), that allows us to encapsulate and model our data in our applications. It gives us access to additional helpers, functions and queries to simply and easily perform CRUD actions.

Mongoose will provide us with the similar functionality to interact with MongoDB and Express, as Active Record will do with PostgreSQL and Rails.

> Active Record is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper). An ODM is the same thing as an ORM, without the relations.

Here's an example of some Mongoose code pulled from  [their documentation](http://mongoosejs.com).

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

var Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', { name: String });

var kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zelda' });

kitty.save(function (err) {
  if (err) // { do something }
  
  console.log('meow');
});
```

<br />

## I Do: Set Up for Mongoose Intro Lesson App (5 minutes / 0:20)

1. Create a new project folder in your `/class-exercises` folder: `$ mkdir mongoose-intro-lesson`

2. `cd` into the new folder. 
3. `$ npm init -y`

3. Create a new database directory inside that folder: `$ mkdir db`

4. Create the following files: `$ touch server.js db/schema.js db/seeds.js`

5. Open the app in sublime: `$ subl .`
    - make sure that your entry point is `server.js`, and not `index.js`.

Your folder structure should look like this:

<br />

### &#x1F535; YOU DO (2 minutes)

Walk through the previous steps to set-up your app

<br />

## I Do: Mongoose and Connection Set Up (5 minutes / 0:25)

For today's in-class Mongoose demonstrations, we will be creating an app that uses two models: `Students` and `Projects`. 

Let's begin by installing Mongoose into our project folder...

```bash
$ npm install --save mongoose
```

In order to have access to `mongoose` in our application, we need to explicitly require Mongoose and open a connection to the database that we specify.

```js
// in the db/schema.js

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/students');
```

The name above `students` will be the name of the app's Mongo database. A cool feature of Mongo is that we don't have to create this database initially. If the database doesn't exist Mongo will instantiate it the first time you try to save something. 

```js
// in the db/schema.js

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/students');

// Use ES6 native promises. We are specifying a Promise library to avoid a depreciation warning in the console.
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;

// Now that we are connected, let's save that connection to the database in a variable. We are just doing this to keep our code DRY.
var db = mongoose.connection;

// Will log an error if db can't connect to MongoDB
db.on('error', function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});

// Will log "database has been connected" if it successfully connects.
db.once('open', function() {
  console.log("database has been connected!");
});

// Disconnect from database
db.close();
```

Now let's run our `db/schema.js` file:

```bash
$ node db/schema.js
```

<br />


### &#x1F535; YOU DO (2 minutes)

Walk through the previous steps

<br />

## Mongoose Schema & Models (10 minutes / 0:40)

#### What is a Mongoose Schema?

* Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema!
* Mongo is schema-less and doesn't require much structure (but it is still a good idea to use a schema).
* Schemas are used to define attributes and structure our documents.
* Each Schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.

Here's an example of a Mongoose schema...

```js
// in the db/schema.js

// First, we instantiate a namespace for our Schema constructor defined by mongoose.
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});
```

> Mongo will add a primary key to each object using `ObjectId`. This will be referenced as an `id` property on each new instance of the object.

#### What are Mongoose Models?

**[Mongoose Models](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)** will represent documents in our database.

* They are essentially constructor functions, which will allow us to preform CRUD actions within our MongoDB Database.
* Models are defined by passing a Schema instance to `mongoose.model`.

```js
// db/schema.js

var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// First, we instantiate a namespace for our Schema constructor defined by mongoose.
var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});

var StudentModel = mongoose.model("Student", StudentSchema);
```

`.model()` makes a copy of the schema.

* The first argument is the singular name of the **collection** that your model is for. Mongoose automatically looks for the plural version of your model name.
* This means that the model name `Student` will correspond to the `students` collection in the database.

<br />

### &#x1F535; YOU DO (2 minutes)

Add the code above to your `db/schema.js` file

<br />

### Mongoose - Schema - Model Summary
_Mongoose_ is an _ODM_ - an **O**bject **D**ocument **M**apper - i.e. it maps objects to documents. Therefore, Mongoose gives us the ability to perform the _CRUD_ operations on a _MongoDB_ database using JavaScript objects as our model objects.

> A _model_ object is an object whose primary concern is to hold data, and represent an instance of a [Domain Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model). For example, if we were developing an application for Delta, we might have Domain Models for Airports, Flights, Passengers, Luggage, etc.  Instances of an Airport Domain Model might be ATL, LAX, JFK, ABQ, etc.

![Object Document Mapping](https://i.imgur.com/YhAXdCB.png)

<br />

## Collections: Embedded Documents & References (10 minutes / 0:50)

Let's add another model to our `db/schema.js`.

* We will be adding a schema for `Project`, since I want to create an application that tracks Students and Projects.
* Like a one-to-many relationship in a relational database, a Student will have many Projects.

In Mongoose, we create this relationship by using **embedded documents**.

<br />

### I Do: Embedded Documents

[Embedded Documents](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/embedded-documents.html) -- sometimes referred to as "sub-documents" -- are schemas of their own, as well as elements in a parent document's array

* They contain all of the same features as normal documents.


```js
// in the db/schema.js

var ProjectSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  unit: String
});

var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  projects: [ProjectSchema]
});

var ProjectModel = mongoose.model("Project", ProjectSchema);
var StudentModel = mongoose.model("Student", StudentSchema);
```
> The **projects key** in your `StudentSchema` document, will contain a special array that has specific methods that work with embedded documents.
>
> The Project Schema must be defined prior to our main Student Schema.

#### Advantages
* Easy to conceptualize and set up.
* Can be accessed quickly.

#### Disadvantages
* Do not scale well. Documents cannot exceed 16MB in size.

> If you find that you are nesting documents within documents for 3+ levels, you should probably look into a relational database. Scroll to the bottom for more info.

<br />

### &#x1F535; YOU DO (2 minutes)

Set Up a Schema and the Model for Projects.

<br />

## CREATE Students and Projects (10 minutes / 1:20)

First let's create an instance of our Student model. Below is an example that describes one way of doing this...

```js
// in the db/schema.js

// First we create a new student. It's just like generating a new instance of a constructor function!
var frankie = new StudentModel({ name: "Frankie P.", age: 30 });

// Then we save it to the database using .save
frankie.save(function(err, student) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  else {
    console.log(student);
  }
});
```

Run `node db/schema.js` in the Terminal to run it. We can also consolidate this code into a single `.create` method, like so...

```js
// in the db/schema.js

StudentModel.create({ name: 'Frankie Q.', age: 31 }, function (err, student) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  else {
    console.log(student);
  }
});
```

#### Why do we have two different ways to persist something to a database?

- Maybe we want to instantiate new instances of something for test purposes, but not actually save it to our database.
- Maybe we want to add something to the new object (like a date/timestamp) or do some additional validation checking before saving.
- **SIDE NOTE:** if you are using the new/save methods, we need to assign the object to a variable

<br />

### &#x1F535; YOU DO (2 minutes)

- Create a new instance of a Student using `new` + `.save`
- Create a new instance of a Student using `.create`

<br />

### I Do: Add Embedded Documents

Next, let's create a Project...

```js
// db/schema.js

var anna = new StudentModel({ name: "Anna", age: 28 });
var project1 = new ProjectModel({ title: "memory game", unit: "JS" });

// Now we add that project to a student's collection / array of projects.
anna.projects.push(project1);

// In order to save that project to the student, we need to call `.save()` on the student -- not the project.
anna.save(function(err, student) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  else {
    console.log(student + " was saved to our db!");
  }
});
```

Run `node db/schema.js` in the Terminal to run the code.

<br />

#### &#x1F535; YOU DO - Practice Adding Students (10 min)

- Create a new Student and add a Project as an embedded document.

<br />


## Seed Data (10 minutes / 1:30)

Let's delete this create code, and actually add some seed some data in our database, from our `seeds.js` file. In order to do that, we need to make sure that we can connect the `schema.js` to the `seeds.js`. Comment out the code we created above, and add the following to the bottom of the `db/schema.js`.

```js
// in the db/schema.js

// The rest of our schema code is up here...

// By adding `module.exports`, we can reference these models in other files by requiring `schema.js`.
module.exports = {
  StudentModel: StudentModel,
  ProjectModel: ProjectModel
};
```

And add the following to `db/seeds.js`...

```js
// in the db/seeds.js

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = require("./schema.js");

var StudentModel = Schema.StudentModel;
var ProjectModel = Schema.ProjectModel;
```

Now let's call some methods in `db/seeds.js` that will populate our database...

```js
// in the db/seeds.js

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = require("./schema.js");

var StudentModel = Schema.StudentModel;
var ProjectModel = Schema.ProjectModel;

// First we clear the database of existing students and projects.
StudentModel.remove({}, function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});

ProjectModel.remove({}, function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});

// Now, we will generate instances of a Student and of their Project.
var becky = new StudentModel({name: "Becky"});
var brandon = new StudentModel({name: "Brandon"});
var steve = new StudentModel({name: "Steve"});

var project1 = new ProjectModel({title: "Project 1!!", unit: "JS"});
var project2 = new ProjectModel({title: "Project 2!!", unit: "Express"});
var project3 = new ProjectModel({title: "Project 3!!", unit: "Angular"});
var project4 = new ProjectModel({title: "Project 4!!", unit: "Rails"});

// create two arrays that we can iterate over
var students = [becky, brandon, steve];
var projects = [project1, project2, project3, project4];

// Here we assign some projects to each student.
students.forEach(function(student, i){
  student.projects.push(projects[i], projects[i + 1]);

  student.save(function(err) {
    if(err) {
      console.log(err);
      return;
    }
    
    console.log(student);
  });
});
```
Now, seed your database by running `node db/seeds.js` in your terminal. Use Ctrl + C to exit running Node.

Let's test if this all worked by opening Mongo in the Terminal...

```bash
$ mongo
$ show dbs
$ use students
$ show collections
$ db.students.find()
```
<br />

### &#x1F535; YOU DO (10 minutes / 1:45)

Add Seed data to your App 

<br />

### Callback Functions

Oftentimes, when making a Mongoose query, we will pass in a callback function (or use a Promise with `exec()`). It will be passed two arguments: `err` and `data`.

* `data` contains the result of the Mongoose query.

<details>

  <summary>Q: Why do you think callbacks/promises might be necessary when using Mongoose?</summary>

  > Because these queries are asynchronous! We want to make sure the query has finished before we run any code that depends on the result.

</details>

<br />

## Mongoose Queries - READ Index/Show (10 minutes / 1:55)

Mongoose provides us with a variety of helper methods that allow us to easily retrieve documents from our database.

> Explore them using the [Mongoose Queries Documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query-js).

```js
// Finds all documents of a specified model type. We can pass in a key-value pair(s) to narrow down the search.
Model.find({}, callback)

// Finds a single model by its id.
Model.findById(someId, callback)

// Find a single model using a key-value pair(s).
Model.findOne({someKey: someValue}, callback)

// Removes documents that match a key-value pair(s).
Model.remove({someKey: someValue}, callback)
```

Let's use `.find()` to implement the `index` functionality. We will do that in the controller file...

```bash
$ mkdir controllers
$ touch controllers/students_controller.js
```

> We are adding a `controllers` directory and `students_controller.js` file to mimic how we might define a controller in an Express application. We will follow REST conventions and use our controllers to listen for incoming requests and communication with our database.


```js
// in the controllers/students_controller.js

var Schema = require("../db/schema.js");
var StudentModel = Schema.StudentModel;
var ProjectModel = Schema.ProjectModel;

var studentsController = {
  index: function() {
    StudentModel.find({})
    .exec(function(err, students) {
      if (err) { 
        console.log(err);
        return;
      }

      students.forEach(function(student) {
        console.log(student);
      });
    });
  }
};

studentsController.index();
```
Run `node controllers/students_controller.js` in the terminal.

> Every model method that accepts query conditions can be executed by means of a callback or the `exec()` method (which is essentially a Mongoose-y promise). http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html

Now let's create a `show` method...

```js
// in controllers/students_controller.js

var studentsController = {
  index: function(){
    StudentModel.find({})
    .exec(function(err, students) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return;
      }

      students.forEach(function(student){
        console.log(student);
      });
    });
  },
  show: function(req) {
    StudentModel.findOne({"name": req.name})
    .exec(function(err, student) {
      if (err) { 
        console.log(err);
        return;
      }
      
      console.log(student);
    });
  }
};

studentsController.show({name: "Becky"});
```

<br />

### &#x1F535; YOU DO  - Index, Show, Update and Delete (15 minutes / 2:10)

Follow the above instructions to implement `index` and `show` for the Student model.

Then use the [Mongoose documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query-js) to figure out how to Update and Delete students. If the documentation proves difficult to navigate, don't be afraid to Google it! We will go over how to Update and Delete after the exercise...

## Validations (Bonus)

Mongoose contains built-in validators and the option to create custom validators as well.

Validators are defined at the field level in a document, and are executed when the document is being saved. If a validation error occurs, the save operation is aborted and the error is passed to the callback.

**Built in Validators:**

* `required` and `unique`: used to validate the field's existence in Mongoose.  These validators are placed in your schema, on the field that you want to validate.

Example: Let's say you want to verify the existence of a username field and ensure that it is unique before you save the user document.

```js
var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  }
  ...
});

```
>This will validate the existence and uniqueness of the username field when saving the document, thus preventing the saving of any document that doesn't contain this field or the username already exists.

* `match`: type based validator for strings, added to the field's object, in your schema.

Continuing off the above example, to validate your email field, you would need to change your StudentSchema as follows:

```js
var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  },
  age: Number,
  email: {
    type: String,
    match: /.+\@.+\..+/
  }
});
```

>The usage of a match validator here, will make sure that the email field value matches the given regex expression, thus preventing the saving of any document where the e-mail doesn't conform to a valid pattern!

* `enum`: helps to define a set of strings that are only available for that field value.

```js
var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  },
  age: Number,
  email: {
    type: String,
    match: /.+\@.+\..+/
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['Admin', 'Instructor', 'Student']
  },

});
```
>By Adding an `enum`, we are adding a validation to ensure that only these three possible strings  ('Admin', 'Instructor', 'Student') are saved in the document.

### Custom Validations

We can also define our own validators by using the `validate` property.

This `validate` property value is typically an array consisting of a validation function.

For example, say that we want to validate the length of a user's password. To do so, you would have to make these changes in your StudentSchema:

```js
var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  password: {
    type: String,
    validate: [
      function(password) {
        return password.length >= 6;
      },
      'Password needs to be at least 6 characters.'
    ]
  },

>This custom validator will make sure that your user's password is at least six characters long, or it will prevent it from saving the document.

* `.pre` validation: middleware/functions that are passed control during the execution of asynchronous functions.

By using `.pre`, these are executed before the validations happen.

```js
StudentSchema.pre("save", function(next) {
    var self = this;

    StudentModel.findOne({email : this.email}, 'email', function(err, results) {
        if(err) {
            next(err);
        }
        else if(results) {
            console.warn('results ', results);
            self.invalidate("email", "email must be unique");
            next(new Error("email must be unique"));
        }
        else {
            next();
        }
    });
});

```

### Multiple Collections & References

Similar to how we use foreign keys to represent a one-to-many relationship in a SQL database, we can add [references](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents) to documents in other collections by storing an array of `ObjectIds` that references document Ids from another model.

```js
// in the db/schema.js

var ProjectSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  unit: String,
  students: [{type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: "Student"}]
});

var StudentSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  projects: [ {type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: "Project"}]
});

var StudentModel = mongoose.model("Student", StudentSchema);
var ProjectModel = mongoose.model("Project", ProjectSchema);
```

> Since we are using an Id to refer to other objects, we use the ObjectId type in the schema definition. The `ref` attribute must match the model used in the definition.

#### Advantages
* Could offer greater flexibility when querying.
* Might be a better decision for scaling.

#### Disadvantages
* Requires more work. Need to find both documents that have the references (i.e., multiple queries).
* Not the way that Mongo was meant to be used.
