# Intro to Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the relationship between `.new()` and `def initialize()`
- Distinguish whether a piece of data is best-suited to being stored in a local, instance, or class variable
- Explain whether given data is best-suited to having its accessibility defined by `attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, or none of the above
- Properly define instance and class variables
- List two ways of defining class methods

## Framing: What is OOP?

Ruby is an object-oriented language. That means it's based on the idea that you'll build your application with objects in mind.

As you learned earlier in the course, an object is a collection of related attributes (properties) and methods (behavior). You can think of an object as a little machine: it has displays you can read and buttons you can push.

When you write an object-oriented application, the idea is that you write the blueprints for these machines, and then you write a sequence of events your users can initiate in which these machines interact with each other.

Much of the code you see today will be very similar to what you encountered in when creating classes in JavaScript. That's because classes are a concept that have been around for quite some time but only just introduced in Javascript (ECMAScript 2016/ES6). Use this pre-existing knowledge to your advantage in today's class!

## You Do: The OOP Process (10 minutes / 0:10)

We've talked quite a bit about object oriented programming as a paradigm, but we haven't talked much about how to break a problem down into object components. 

#### Example: Monopoly

> "Monopoly is a game where players try to accumulate wealth through property ownership and money"

- Game Board
- Players
- Game Tokens
- Property Cards
- Money

#### Example: Facebook

> "Facebook is an application where users can post statuses and add friends."

- Users
- Statuses
- Friends

Breaking your ideas down gives you a starting place for what those objects may be.

Spend 10 minutes working with a partner to come up with at least three types of objects that you might define when creating the following examples.

  1. Amazon
  2. A Homework Grading App
  3. An Attendance Taking App
  4. Lyft

> A helpful approach might be to take the "nouns" involved in the application and say they are objects.

## Our First Object (10 minutes / 0:20)

 Say that we have a car. Each of us has a mental model of what a car is: it has four wheels, runs on gas, has a steering wheel that allows us to drive it, etc. This blueprint is like a **class**. Now, when we see a car in front of us, this is like an **instance**, it's an actual **object** in front of us. Each **object** has its blueprint, and is an **instance** of that blueprint or **class**.

A **class** is a blueprint from which objects are made. In Javascript we used classes, which operate very similarly to **classes** in Ruby. Each object made from a class is an instance of that class. Each instance of a class is an object.

Let's define a `User` class. We'll be using `binding.pry` to test our code in pry.

```bash
$ touch app.rb
```

```rb
require "pry"

class User

  def set_name_to(some_string)
    @name = some_string
  end

  def get_name
    return @name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hi! My name is #{@name}!"
  end

end

binding.pry

puts "end of file"
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>What about this Ruby class looks similar to a Javascript class?</strong></summary>

  The `class` keyword. The class contains methods.
</details>


Now let's generate some instances of this class...

```rb
alice = User.new
alice.set_name_to("alice")
puts alice.get_name

madhatter = User.new
madhatter.set_name_to("Mad Hatter")
puts madhatter.get_name

alice.greet
madhatter.greet
```

#### Some Questions

Is `User` a(n)...
- class?
- instance?

Is `alice` a(n)...
- class?
- instance?

`User.greet` throws an error. `alice.greet` works fine. So we can deduce that the `greet` method can only be called on...
- instances of the `User` class?
- the `User` class itself?

Thus, would it make sense to call `greet` a(n)...
- "instance method"?
- "class method"?

`User.new` works fine. `alice.new` throws an error. So we can deduce that the `new` method can only be called on...
- instances of the `User` class?
- the `User` class itself?

Thus, it would be make sense to call `new` a(n)...
- "instance method"?
- "class method"?

<details>

  <summary>
    `class User` works fine. `class user` throws an error. What's a rule we can deduce about classes from this?
  </summary>

  > Class names must begin with a capital letter. This is not optional.

</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    `class UserName` works fine. `class User Name` throws an error. What's a rule we can deduce about classes from this?
  </summary>

  > Class names cannot contain spaces.

</details>

## Initializing Users (10 minutes / 0:30)

<details>
  <summary><strong>What was the purpose of a constructor function in Javascript classes?</strong></summary>

  > To initialize any properties we want a class instance to have when it is created.

</details>

Ruby classes have an equivalent to Javascript constructors: the `initialize` method!

```rb
require 'pry'

class User

  def initialize
    puts "I'm a new User"
  end

  def set_name_to(some_string)
    @name = some_string
  end

  def get_name
    return @name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hi! My name is #{@name}!"
  end

end

binding.pry

puts "end of file"
```

```rb
alice = User.new
alice.greet

madhatter = User.new
madhatter.greet


puts alice
puts madhatter
```

<details>
  <summary>What can we conclude about the relationship of `def initialize` and `.new`? (Hint: it serves the same purpose as Javascript's constructor function)</summary>
- The `initialize` method is run every time `.new` is called.
- Use `.new` to create a new object.
- `initialize` is called automatically if defined in a class.
- `.new` is a method of the class.
- `initialize` is a method of the instance.
- Call to `new` must come first; until you call `new` there is no instance to call `initialize` on.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is this different from other User instance methods we've seen?</summary>

   `initialize` can only be called by the `.new` class method (i.e. it only runs once when the object is initially created).

</details>


### You Can Pass Arguments to `initialize`

`initialize` is a special method in its relationship to `.new`, but otherwise it behaves like any other method. This means you can pass arguments to it (again, just like Javascript's `constructor`)...

```rb
require "pry"

class User

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    puts "I'm a new User named #{firstname} #{lastname}"
  end

end

binding.pry

puts "end of file"
```

```rb
# pry
harry = User.new("Harry", "Potter")
# I'm a new User named Harry Potter
# => #<User:0x007f96f312b240>
```

### Instance Variables (10 minutes / 0:40)

Let's create a method that prints the full name of the user.

In Ruby, normal variables are available only inside the method in which they were created.

If you put an `@` before the variable's name, it becomes an instance variable and therefore available inside the entire `instance` in which it was created.

```rb
class User

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

end
```

```rb
# pry
harry = User.new("Harry", "Potter")
# => #<User:0x007faf3903f670 @firstname="Harry", @lastname="Potter">
harry.full_name
# => "Harry Potter"
```

### Getting and Setting Properties

To **get** Harry's first name, we can't simply type `harry.firstname`. To **set** Harry's first name, we can't simply type `harry.firstname = "Harry"`

The only things available **outside** an instance are its methods. `@firstname` is a property, not a method. We can't access data inside of an instance unless it contains methods that let us do so.

To make a property "gettable" and "settable", we need to create "getter" and "setter" methods for it.

```rb
class User

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

  def get_firstname
    return @firstname
  end

  def set_firstname(firstname)
    @firstname = firstname
  end

end
```

```rb
# pry
harry = User.new("Harry", "Potter")
# => #<User:0x007faf3903f670 @firstname="Harry", @lastname="Potter">
puts harry.get_firstname
# "Harry"
harry.set_firstname("Ginny")
puts harry.get_firstname
# "Ginny"
```

## attr_accessor

Recall how we couldn't simply type `Harry.firstname = "some other name"` the previous example.

```rb
class User

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

  def get_firstname
    return @firstname
  end

  def set_firstname(firstname)
    @firstname = firstname
  end

end
```

```rb
harry = User.new("Harry", "Potter")
harry.firstname = "Ginny"
# This throws an error
harry.set_firstname("Ginny")
puts harry.get_firstname
# =>
```

If only there were a way to define a class so that we don't have to define a getter and setter method for every single property...

```rb
class User

  attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

end
```

```rb
nayana = User.new("Nayana", "Davis")
nayana.firstname = "Nayana"
puts nayana.firstname
```

<details>
  <summary>We now can directly access properties on the User instance, so we can deduce that `attr_accessor` is a shortcut that does what?</summary>

  > It creates getter and setter methods for the `firstname` instance variable.

</details>

### `attr_accessor` is actually a shortcut that combines two other shortcuts

#### `attr_accessor` is `attr_reader` combined with `attr_writer`.

`attr_reader` makes an attribute readable, `attr_writer` makes an attribute writeable. `attr_accessor` makes an attribute both readable **AND** writeable.

To illustrate the difference between `attr_reader` and `attr_writer`, let's have a look at the code below.

```rb
class User
  attr_reader :firstname
  attr_writer :lastname

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

end
```
```rb
hermione = User.new("Hermione", "Granger")
hermione.firstname
# => "Hermione"
hermione.lastname
# => Error!
hermione.firstname = "Ginny"
# => Error!
hermione.lastname = "Weasley"
hermione.full_name
# => "Hermione Weasley"
```

`attr_reader` creates a *getter* method only. Trying to do `hermione.firstname = "Ginny"` will fail.

`attr_writer` creates a *setter* method only. Trying to do `puts hermione.lastname` will fail.

`attr_accessor` creates getters and setters.
> You will most commonly use `attr_accessor`

-------

## Class Attributes / Variables (5 minutes / 1:25)

Let's come up with a way of keeping track of how many users have been created total...

```rb
class User
  attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname
  @@all = 0

  def count
    return @@all
  end

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
    @@all += 1
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end
end
```

```rb
harry = User.new("Harry", "Potter")
harry.count
# => 1
ron = User.new("Ron", "Weasley")
harry.count
# => 2
ron.count
# => 2
draco = User.new("Draco", "Malfoy")
harry.count
# => 3
ron.count
# => 3
draco.count
# => 3
```

But there's something weird going on here: note that we aren't counting the number of Rons, Harrys or Dracos. Think about what `.count` might be returning. More on this in a moment!

A variable name beginning with `@@` is a **class variable**. Every instance of a class has the same value for this variable. It cannot be accessed with `attr_accessor`. You have to actually create a method to access it.

### Class Attributes and Methods Together (10 minutes / 1:40)

A method name beginning with the class name is a **class method**. It is attached to the class itself, rather than to instances. There are also methods you call on `User` itself. So far we've only seen `.new`.It would make more sense if, in order to retrieve the total number of users, we ran `User.count` instead of `harry.count`...

```rb
class User
  attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname
  @@all = 0

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
    @@all += 1
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

  # You could also define this as `def self.count`, where self represents the class
  def User.count
    return @@all
  end

end
```

```rb
ginny = User.new("Ginny", "Weasley")
ginny.count
# => Error!
User.count
# => 1
```

## Self (5 minutes / 1:45)

`self` is a special variable that contains the current instance of an object (like `this` in Javascript). It's how the object refers to it*self*.

`self` has another context as well: `def self.all` Here, `self` refers to `class User`. What does this mean? It means that the method `.all` is called on the class `User`, much like `.new`, and is therefore a class method.

```rb
class User
  attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname
  @@all = []

  def initialize(firstname, lastname)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
    # here, `self` refers to the current instance
    puts "Creating #{self.firstname}"
    @@all.push(self)
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

  # Can also be written as `def User.all`
  # here, `self` refers to the class
  def self.all
    return @@all
  end

end
```

```rb
draco = User.new("Draco", "Malfoy")
# "Creating Draco"
luna = User.new("Luna", "Lovegood")
# "Creating Luna"
bellatrix = User.new("Bellatrix", "LeStrange")
# "Creating Bellatrix"
User.all
# => [#<User @firstname="Draco">, #<User @firstname="Luna">, #<User @firstname="Bellatrix">]
```

## Break (10 minutes / 1:55)

## You Do: Orange Tree (25 minutes / 2:20)

> From Chris Pine's "Learn to Program - Second Edition": p 112, section 13.6

Make an OrangeTree class that has...

- a `height` method that returns its height in feet
  - it's initial value should be determined by some input
  - hint: you don't necessarily have to define the method
- a `one_year_passes` method that, when called, ages the tree one year. Start the age at `0`.

> Test your code.

- Each year the tree grows taller by one foot
- After 50 years the tree should "die" (its height goes to 0)

> Test your code.

- After the first 5 years, the tree bears 20 oranges
- You should be able to `count_the_oranges`, which returns the number of oranges on the tree

> Test your code.

- You should be able to `pick_an_orange`, which reduces the number of oranges by 1
- Ensure that your tree cannot have negative oranges
- Ensure that after each year your tree has 20 total oranges again

> Test your code.

- The number of oranges the tree bears each year is equal to 20 plus the age of the tree

#### Bonus

Create an `OrangeTreeOrchard` class that manages multiple `OrangeTrees`. It can...

- Age all the trees by one year
- Pick and count all the fruit
- Calculate average height and fruit of all orange trees

## Closing / Questions (10 minutes / 2:30)

## Sample Questions

- Create a Ruby class for a student, initialized with a name and an age.
  - Write a getter for name and age, and a setter for name only
  - Create a new student and demonstrate using all the methods
- Explain the difference between local and instance variables

## Bonus: Public and Private (5 minutes / 1:50)

### You Do

- Draw a picture of a machine, real or imaginary, that has inputs (buttons, switches, keypads...) and displays (dials, lights, screens...). Label what they do.
- Most machines have internal gauges or memories that help it make decisions: temperature monitors, voltage monitors, hard disks, and so on. These are visible only inside the machine: whoever's using the machine can't see them. Draw two of these on your machine and label them.

By default all instance and class methods are *public*, except for `def initialize` which is *private*. This means they're visible to other objects. An analogy: they're functions that have their own buttons on the outside of the machine, like a car's turn signal.

There may be methods that all other objects don't need to know about.

```rb
class User
  attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname
  @@all = []

  def initialize(firstname, lastname, password)
    @firstname = firstname
    @lastname = lastname
    @password = encrypt(password)
    @@all.push(self)
  end

  def full_name
    return "#{@firstname.capitalize} #{@lastname.capitalize}"
  end

  def User.all
    return @@all
  end

  private
  def encrypt(input)
    return input.reverse
  end

end
```

```rb
harry = User.new("Harry", "Potter", "Expecto Patronum")
# #<User @firstname="Harry" @password="munortaP otcepxE">
harry.encrypt("Expecto Patronum")
# Error! Private method `encrypt`
```

Putting `private` in front of methods means they can be used inside the object, but are not available outside it. An analogy: they're functions that do not have their own buttons on the outside of the machine, like a car's air filter.

`private` is useful mostly for keeping things organized. Consider jQuery: It's already cluttered enough, with all these methods like `.fadeOut` and `.css`. It has lots of other methods hidden inside it that we don't really need to know about.

## Review: Why OOP?

#### Easy to Understand

Objects help us build programs that model how we tend to think about the world.
Instead of a bunch of variables and functions (procedural style), we can group
relevant data and functions into objects, and think about them as individual,
self-contained units. This grouping of properties (data) and methods is called
*encapsulation*.

#### Managing Complexity

This is especially important as our programs get more and more complex. We can't
keep all the code (and what it does) in our head at once. Instead, we often want
to think just a portion of the code.

Objects help us organize and think about our programs. If I'm looking at code
for a Squad object, and I see it has associated *people*, and those people can
dance when the squad dances, I don't need to think about or see all the code
related to a person dancing. I can just think at a high level "ok, when a squad
dances, all it's associated people dance". This is a form of *abstraction*... I
don't need to think about the details, just what's happening at a high-level.

#### Ensuring Consistency

One side effect of *encapsulation* (grouping data and methods into objects) is
that these objects can be in control of their data. This usually means ensuring
consistency of their data.

Consider the bank account example... I might define a bank account object
such that you can't directly change it's balance. Instead, you have to use the
`withdrawl` and `deposit` methods. Those methods are the *interface* to the
account, and they can enforce rules for consistency, such as "balance can't be
less than zero".

#### Modularity

If our objects are well-designed, then they interact with each other in
well-defined ways. This allows us to refactor (rewrite) any object, and it
should not impact (cause bugs) in other areas of our programs.
