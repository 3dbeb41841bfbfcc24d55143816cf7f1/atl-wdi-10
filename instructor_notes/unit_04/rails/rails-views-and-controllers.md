## Framing (5 / 5)

In our introduction to Rails, we got a quick overview of how Rails' MVC architecture utilizes HTTP and REST protocols to properly handle requests and responses to drive application behavior.

In this lesson, we'll go more in depth into the inner workings of a Rails App, exploring the pieces involved in a request-response lifecycle.

**(ST-WG)** As a quick review, Why is the MVC structure so important?

> Interesting to note, the early MVC architects layed the foundational building blocks paving the way for the launch of GUI programming: [MVC History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller#History)

Today, we're going to continue the deeper dive into the why and how of "The Rails Way" for each of the major components of the MVC structure.

The M: **Models** and migrations give us a systematic, iterable way to organize, store, retrieve, and modify a database, using ActiveRecord as an interface to map our database tables into objects in Ruby.

Where as the models normally provide a way to encapsulate business logic and data, **Views & Controllers** are responsible for telling us what to do and how to display that data.

### Doc Dive (5 / 10)

### Turn & Talk (5 / 15)

With a partner, discuss:

1. What is the role of a controller in a Rails application?
2. What are the conventions for naming Rails controllers?
3. What are the benefits following the 'Rails Way'?

### rMVC: Revisited (10 / 25)

The design pattern that rails is built around is rMVC - Router, Model, View and Controller.

![rMVC](https://i.imgur.com/147nsdW.png)

**Question:** Who can remind us the role the View plays in a Rails application?

Life Cycle of a request/response in Rails:

1. A user of our web application submits a request to our application's server. It can come in a myriad of ways. Maybe someone typing in a URL and hitting enter or maybe a user submitting a form on our application.

2. The request hits the router of the application.

3. The application than either doesn't recognize the route (error) or it does recognize it(route) and sends it to a controller.

4. Once the request hits the controller, its then going to query the database through Active Record(the model) for the information specified in the controller.

5. Once the controller has the information from the model that it needs, it sends it to the view

6. The view takes the objects from the controller, and sends a response to the user.

Let's dive into an example, and see MVC in action by writing some Rails code.

## Set-Up (5 / 30)

The starter code for this lesson already has all the Active Record components completed, no need to add anything there, you will be building that section from scratch in another class.

To get started, clone down the following repo:

**Note**: If you have trouble setting up, please "#SlackTheBack"

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum/tunr-views-and-controllers
cd tunr-views-and-controllers
git checkout starter-code
git checkout -b inclass
```
After you start working on a new branch, from the terminal run:
```
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```
Here, we are just installing our app's dependencies, and running the set up for our app's database locally.

To test that it works, try starting the server:

```
rails s
```

Then in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000` to visit your app in its default development environment and you should be greeted by Ruby on Rails welcome page. Success!

----

A good place to start reviewing our code base so far, in any rails app, is our application's routes.

## Route-Controller-Action Relationship (10 / 40)

Make sure you are in the applications directory and in your terminal run:
 `$ rails routes`

```bash
Prefix      Verb   URI Pattern                 Controller#Action
    artists GET    /artists(.:format)          artists#index
artists_new GET    /artists/new(.:format)      artists#new
            POST   /artists(.:format)          artists#create
            GET    /artists/:id(.:format)      artists#show
            GET    /artists/:id/edit(.:format) artists#edit
            PUT    /artists/:id(.:format)      artists#update
            DELETE /artists/:id(.:format)      artists#destroy
```
Rails routes allows us at any time to view the current routes of this app and see the controller actions mapped to each route.

For example, let's look at the request/response life cycle of a get request hitting the `artists` `index` action.

When a user visits: `http:localhost:3000/artists`

- The user types in a url, which triggers a request to the server. It hits the router. The router says, "a GET request to the '/artists' path? No problem! Hey, `artists` controller, you need to perform the `index` action"

- The `artists` controller says, "An index action? I've got one of those. Lets see, it says here I need to ask the model for information about all of the artists. Hey, ActiveRecord Model, gimme that data!"

- Thanks for all the artists, Now I'm going to send all this information to the view. The view than generates a response to the client.

Let's write the code to make this response a reality.

## Define an Index Action and View (15 / 55)

We need to first create a controller for our artists. In your terminal:

```bash
 $ rails g controller Artists
```
> **Note** the convention for naming this file: plural resource name, snake_case

In that file, let's define our controller

```ruby
# in app/controllers/artists_controller.rb
class ArtistsController < ApplicationController
  # actions will go here
end
```

Great, now that we have a new controller for artists, let's go over what we want to include in our controller.

Recalling from our routes, there are 7 RESTful calls that the router has mapped to our `artists_controller` actions.

Right now we know our controller is pretty blank, but let's fire up our server:

```bash
$ rails s # short for rails server
```
and in our browser, visit the route to view all artists:

`http://localhost:3000/artists`

What do we see?
<br>
![unknown_action](https://i.imgur.com/2XmTkAS.png)

When we go to `http://localhost:3000/artists` our router says it knows where to send it. It's sending it to the artists controller and expects it to do the index action. Unfortunately we haven't defined it yet, so it's unknown. Let's go ahead and define that action now

In `app/controllers/artists_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class ArtistsController < ApplicationController

  def index

  end
end
```

> Rails methods defined in our controllers are known as `actions`

Great let's reload:

![template_missing](https://i.imgur.com/Fgm20Ms.png)

Another error... We'll get more into this later. But this one is yelling at us for not having a view(template) yet. Specifically in this case, the index view. So let's create that. Let's first make a directory and file in the terminal:

```bash
$ mkdir app/views/artists
$ touch app/views/artists/index.html.erb
```

> Note the conventions here. We needed to make an `artists` folder to put the `index.html.erb` in it. This is important because when we define an `action` in our controller, rails knows to render the view corresponding to the controller and action. In this example, because were calling the `index` action in the `artists_controller`, it'll look for the `index` view in the `artists` folder.

- Inside `app/views/artist/index.html.erb`:
  - Just put: `<h1>All Artists</h1>`

Great, now let's refresh the page and there should be no more errors so we know everything has been wired up correctly!

However, let's think about what we really want to see when we visit this page. When we visit `/artists`, we expect to see information about all artists!

So now the question is how can we dynamically generate a view for all of our data about artists?

What does it mean to have our view update dynamically?

> Means we can write abstractive code that will update and render the appropriate data for all the records in our query. Can you imagine if you were a store with 5000 products, having to write out or hard code all those listings?

Lets use [Facebook](http:/facebook.com) as an example:

Facebook has like 4 billion users. They definitely do not have 4 billion profile HTML pages lying around -- that would be a ridiculous amount of data. Instead, they have ONE HTML page lying around, and when you look at someone's profile they insert the appropriate data into the appropriate places in that HTML, and send your computer the result.

## Break (10 / 65)

### Instance Variables (10 / 70)

Reviewing what we learned in our intro to Rails class, controllers are responsible for fetching the correct data from our models. But now we need a way to pass this data to be displayed in our views.

The way Rails solves this problem is by extending the functionality of Ruby's **instance variables**

**Question:** Quick review, what was special about instance variables in the context of Ruby classes?

> A:  Every instance of a class has a different set of instance variables which are accessible throughout a class definition.

In Rails, we use instance variables in our **controller actions**, so we can have **programmatic access to variables inside of our views**. More often than not these instance variables will contain objects from the database.

Let's use our friend Active Record to query our database for all artists and save that to an instance variable.

In the index action:
```ruby
def index
  @artists = Artist.all
end
```

Now, in our index view, we have programmatic access to the variable `@artists`!

> It should be noted that while we practice a separation of concerns we aren't just limited to querying for only artists in the artists controller. Additionally, we can store just about anything we could have normally stored in a ruby variable.

Let's write some code in our view to display this data.

In our `app/views/artists/index.html.erb`
```html
<h1>Artists <a href="/artists/new">(+)</a></h1>

<ul>
  <% @artists.each do |artist| %>
    <li>
      <a href="/artists/<%= artist.id %>">
        <%= artist.name %>
      </a>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Now when we visit `/artists` in the browser, we see a list (index) of all artists. We have included links to the new page, and for the show page, but we haven't created those yet so....

#### Params

In general, `params` values can come from the **query string of a GET request**, the **form data of a POST request**, or from the **path of the URL**.

In order to access those values from Rails `params`, we just have to treat it like any other hash we want data from.

> [More about Rails' Params](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6885990/rails-params-explained)

We'll talk more about params when we get to forms, and adding a new artist. For now, its important to see the connection between what values the user dynamically enters, and how we can have programmatic access to those values.

### You-Do: Show and New Actions (15 / 85)

- Define `show`, and `new` controller actions for `artists`
- Create `show`, and `new` views for `artists`
  - Your `show` view should contain relevant info about a particular artists: such as its `name`, `nationality`, and a photo
- When you visit the `new` page, you should see a header with `New Artist` as text for your html

If you finish early:
- Research Rails `form for` [helper methods](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#dealing-with-model-objects) and think about how you would include a form to get user input necessary to create a new artist instance and have it persist . What happens within Rails when we hit submit on the form?

## WE-DO: Artists Create Action (20 / 105)

So at this point we have a way to see all artists, view info about a specific artist. Let's continue on by adding a form for the user to add their own artists to our application.

In Rails, we have access to a variety of helper methods to erase the pain of having to writing repetitive boilerplate `html` code.

This seems like a great time to utilize Rails `form_for` [helper method](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#dealing-with-model-objects):

```
<%= form_for @artist do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :name %>
  <%= f.text_field :name %>

  <%= f.label :nationality %>
  <%= f.text_field :nationality %>

  <%= f.label :photo_url %>
  <%= f.text_field :photo_url %>

  <%= f.submit "Create" %>
<% end %>
```

Here, we are essentially saying we want a form that will result in the creation of a new instance, in this case `@artist`. In the form body, we just have to make sure that our fields match our Model's attributes and we should be good to go.

Basically, this helper with compile down to html, and the Rails will fill in the appropriate information particular to our app.

Great, but what happens when we try to submit this form?

If we were looking in our browser, we would get our old friend `unknown action` error, saying:
`The action 'create' could not be found for ArtistsController`

Let's write that action for our controller and get this form to work.

In `app/controllers/artists_controller.rb`:

```ruby
# Artists#Create
def create
    form_artist = params[:artist]
    @artist = Artist.create!(name: form_artist[:name], nationality: form_artist[:nationality], photo_url: form_artist[:photo_url])
    redirect_to "/artists/#{@artist.id}"
  end
 ```

With this action, we want to create an instance using the params the user entered into the form, and we also set up a check to see whether or not the model was stored in our database.

**Note** When the request completes, we now need to worry about where to direct the user after adding a new artist.

### Render vs Redirect (5 / 110)

Rails has variety of ways to map our app's logic navigating a user's request to a response they care about.

The one way you will use the most often is a `redirect`. Using Rails `redirect_to` helper method, we can take a request from a client, and then without sending a response back right away, we can make a new request back to the browser, which will trigger the response we want.

In the example of our `create` action, we are mapping a `POST` request to this action, so all we should do is care about how to process the accompanying data, but we then need to hand off to another action to decide which response to send.


Another way to control what the response will be for a particular request, is to utilize Rails `render` helper method.
The `render` is responsible for deciding the format of the view, and which template to serve the browser.

For an example, let's take a closer look at the `index` action of our Artists Controller:

```ruby
def index
  @artists = Artist.all
end
```
Given what we just covered with render:

**Question:** How are we able to see the artists `index` view page, when we went to our index route?

> You'll notice that we're not explicitly telling the application which view file to render.

That's because Rails has implicit rendering. Basically Rails is smart enough to know if the `artists` controller action is called `index`, then it will look for the `index` view in the `artists` folder.

You can explicitly change the implicit render by calling the `render` method in the action of a controller. Something like this:

```ruby
def index
  @artists = Artist.all
  render :index
end
```

**(ST-WG):** What are the differences between redirecting and rendering?

## Break ( 10 / 120 )

## (I-DO) Sanitization/Strong Params (10 / 130)

Looking at the code for the `artists#create` method, we find this line:

```rb
  @artist = Artist.create!(name: params[:name], nationality: params[:nationality], photo_url: params[:photo_url])
```

We're only submitting 3 fields so that's not so bad, but if we were submitting 50 fields that would mean we have to write a HUGE line.

If only there was some way to not have to do that!

Instead of one argument for each field in a record, `.create` can actually take one argument in total that is a hash of all the fields that should be updated. For instance:

```rb
@artist = Artist.create!({
  name: "John",
  nationality: "German",
  photo_url: "http://image.com/john.jpg"
})
```

But instead of hard-coding these values, we need to get them from the `post` request triggered by the form submission.

In general, `params` values can come from the **query string of a GET request**, the **form data of a POST request**, or from the **path of the URL**.

In order to access those values from Rails `params`, we just have to treat it like any other hash we want data from.

> [More about Rails' Params](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6885990/rails-params-explained)

In our `artists` controller, lets place a `binding.pry` in the first line of `create` action so that we can pause our program at that point, and look around to what we have access to in `params`

```ruby
def create
  binding.pry
  @artist = Artist.create!(name: params[:name], nationality: params[:nationality], photo_url: params[:photo_url])
end
```

If you submit the form now, and check your terminal for the value of `params`, you should see something like:

```
{
    "authenticity_token"=>"I04y1td+X5CIiVdZ50ABEGAy6f0LCJReSDa5eq5/GvXICDkUpeu2peCt/BlPHmU1VSadWvzXUy/9uyNixjrP+A==",
    "artist"=>{
        "name"=>"John",
        "photo_url"=>"http://images.google.com/john.jpg",
        "nationality"=>"German"
    }
}
```

That's all the data that was submitted with the form. Notice all of the artist's data is now inside its own hash **inside** the params hash.

Update the controller to receive that param:

``` rb
def create
  @artist = Artist.create!(params[:artist])
end
```

However, in the browser, you get:

```
# ERROR!!!
# ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError in ArtistsController#create
```

Wat?! Why can't we create an `artist` using the hash available in params? This is a security feature of Rails: `params` could include extra fields that have been maliciously added to the form. This extra data could be harmful, therefore Rails requires us to whitelist fields that are allowed through form submissions.

### Strong Params

Whitelisting is done using **strong parameters** configuration!

This is a security feature of Rails: params could include extra fields that have been maliciously added to the form. This extra data could be harmful, therefore Rails requires us to whitelist fields that are allowed through form submissions.

Now we should update our Artists controller a bit.

First let's create a private method that will allow us to pull information from the form.

in `app/controllers/artists_controller.rb`:
```ruby
private
def artist_params
  params.require(:artist).permit(:name, :photo_url, :nationality)
end
```

> The `require` method ensures that a specific parameter is present. Throws an error otherwise. The `permit` method returns a copy of the parameters object, returning only the permitted keys and values.

> **Note** that we encapsulate the `artist_params` in a private method because we only want this available to this particular class and it shouldn't work outside the scope of the controller

The only thing we have left to do is update our controller actions that use params to create or update an artist.

in `app/controllers/artists_controller.rb`:

```ruby
#### before
def create
  @artist = Artist.create!(params[:artist])
  redirect_to "/artists/#{@artist.id}"
end

#### after  
def create
  @artist = Artist.create!(artist_params)
  redirect_to "/artists/#{@artist.id}"
end
```

Great, now we're protected!

## You-Do: (15 / 145)

- Define `edit`, `update` and `destroy` controller actions.
- Create an `edit` view file.
- When you visit the `edit` page, the relevant form should be displayed
- Upon submitting the form, artist info updates accordingly.
- Create a way to destroy an artist

## Bonus: Songs

- Define 7 RESTful routes and map to appropriate songs controller actions.
- Create a songs controller
- Define 7 CRUD actions
- Create appropriate view files

## Closing (5 / 150)

- Who can remind us of the importance of a controller?
- How does the view access data?
- What is the difference between render and redirect?
- How does strong params protect us from malicious input?
