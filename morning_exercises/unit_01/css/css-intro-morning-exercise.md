### Morning Exercise - CSS Basics Scavenger Hunt

- Use Google and this tutorial as a reference: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
- Try to focus on finding the answers quickly, rather than memorizing all of the CSS info in front of you. Using documentation to quickly find answers is a skill you will use forever!

### Work in pairs to answer these questions on your desk:
1. `<h1>Some very important text</h1>`
    - What are two ways I could change the text color for this header to `red`?
    - How could I make sure all `<h1>` tags in my document have a `20px` font size?

2. `<p id="first-paragraph">Some text</p>`
   <br>`<p id="second-paragraph">Some more text</p>`

   - What is one way I could change the `font-family` for only the `second-paragraph` above?

3. What behavior triggers `:hover` styling?

4. Would my `:valid` selector styling display properly in `Firefox 3.0`?

5. What is one other website I could use as a reference for `CSS` questions?
