#Day 1: Tip Calculator
___
We all know the struggles that come at the end of a delicious meal when dining out. Splitting the bill. Luckily for you and your poss√©, you're a brilliant developer that has finished Learning Ruby the Hard Way over the weekend and can create an application that allows you to split the bill, WITH TAX && TIP!

You can't wait to demonstrate your prowess and live up to your street name as `The Ruby Maestro`, so you bust out your brand new Macbook in the middle of a 3-star Michelin restaurant, open up Atom, and begin to code in your `main.rb`.
___
##The objectives
Your calculator will ask for 4 inputs:
- The subtotal
- # of people
- Give an option of how much tip to leave
- % tax

___
After you input these 4 in the calculator, the calculator should take those inputs into a mathematical calculation and give us the total and how much each person pays to 2 decimal places.

The user flow and messages you send are completely up to you!

-**For tips, let the user pick an option 1-4, and based on the number they pick, it runs and action after. (Hint: Use conditionals)**<br/>
- 1 = 15%
- 2 = 18%
- 3 = 20%
- 4 = User picks

-**Remember that tax and tip is based off the subtotal!**
