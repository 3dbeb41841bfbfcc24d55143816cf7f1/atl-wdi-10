# Documentation Treasure Hunt: Ruby Methods

![image](http://www.nothomesyndrome.com/uploads/2/1/0/0/21007102/281547392.jpg?405)

We are going kick off the week enjoying our favorite past-time -- reading [ documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/)!!
For this exercise, we'd like you to _only_ use the Ruby's docs -- that way, you get
very comfortable looking things up there.

Each correct answer is worth 1 point. Try and find the best possible solution. If you're not sure, take a guess, since you won't lose points if you're wrong.

The team with the most points after 30 minutes wins!

Ready.... Set..... Go!!!
