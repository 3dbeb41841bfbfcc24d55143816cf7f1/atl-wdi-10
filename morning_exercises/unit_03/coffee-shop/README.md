# Exercise: Christine's Coffee Shop

:coffee: :coffee: :coffee: :coffee:

## Setup

You are given the same set up as homework:

  - `index.html` where you will add all your html
  - `css/styles.css` for styling your app
  - `js/app.js` where you will write your controller and the coffee list lives there

### Directions

Create an app that:

  - Lists all coffee items: name + price + Show button
  - Clicking on the show button will render a side-menu where you can see the Coffee Name, Price, and image.
  - Add a search box and be able to filter results

### Bonus

  - Clicking on the image will toggle the image as hiding or showing
  - Add CSS: any coffee item whose `size` property is:
    - "small" make the image 100px wide
    - "medium" make the image 200px wide
    - "large" leave the image as is
