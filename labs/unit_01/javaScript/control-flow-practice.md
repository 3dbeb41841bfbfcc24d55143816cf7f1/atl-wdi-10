  * If the user is less than 18, then he/she can't enter and should have a message telling him/her that he/she's too young.
  * If the user is between 18 and 21, he/she should receive a message that he/she can enter, but not drink.
  * If the user is older than 21, he/she should receive a message that he/she can both enter and drink.
