## Initializing a page
1. In your `~/Desktop/ga/labs/unit-01` folder:
    - create (mkdir) a new folder called `html_blog_practice`
    - cd into it
    - create (touch) an `index.html`
    - `subl .` into the folder
    - set up a basic html page with `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, and `body` tags.
1. Add some content to the page
1. Open the page in your browser- right click on the page to open it

## basic tags
1. Pretend you are preparing a paper with title, headings, and sub headings
1. Add the relevant heading tags
1. Add some fake content as if they were paragraphs- use your favorite lorem ipsum

## specific structure
1. In your page, add `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section`, and `nav` tags where appropriate
1. insert placeholder text

## elements
1. Add a list to your navigation section.  Put some items in with content. Later we'll make these links.
1. Choose some random chunks of text to make bold and italics

## decorative elements
1. After each sub section of your page, add a horizontal line

## List some common tags that have attributes
1. In your navigation, add actual links to other sites
1. For each sub section, between the header and the beginning of the placeholder text, add an image.

## Describe what Semantic HTML means
1. Go to a favorite web page of yours
1. Write down what kind of tag you think is being used for each piece of text

**If you want to get an idea of colors on a webpage, I use the chrome extension- eye dropper.  It allows you to pick a color on a web page, and will show you the hsl, rgb, hex and color variable name (if there is one).**
