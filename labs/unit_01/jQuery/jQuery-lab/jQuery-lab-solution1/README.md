Use jQuery!!

- Create an a keyup event listener that responds with an alert('Spacebar!'), whenever the spacebar is pressed. [hint](https://api.jquery.com/keyup/)

- When a user clicks on a team logo, perform an on click that will...
	- Append a `<p>` tag under the clicked element (hint: use the keyword `this`)
	- Insert the team name into the `<p>` tag (hint: use the provided array containing the team names). Do not hardcode the team name!
	- Hide the other remaining teams
	- Upon clicking anywhere, it will display all teams again and the `<p>` tag will be removed
