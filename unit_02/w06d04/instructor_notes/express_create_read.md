# Create and Read with Express

### Objectives

- Understand `module.exports` and why we use it
- Write an HTML form that can make POST requests
- Describe how inputs transform into a req.body object on the server side
- Use bodyParser to read parameters passed from forms via POST requests
- Build RESTful routes that are wired to the correct semantically named view

### Preparation

*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Identify HTTP verbs, with crud actions, and view layers
- Build routes
- Pass parameters via dynamic segments and query parameters

<br>

## Intro

So far we've created routes in Express and passed parameters from the browser to our server. We've constructed our views and dynamically built our html using Handlebars.

But now we're going to see the glue that ties this all together – forms.

For brevity, we're going to start with some starter code. While it would absolutely be good for you to build this all from scratch, it's important to make sure we focus right now on the one _new_ piece of our application structure: passing information from the client to our server and persisting that data in a data structure, and sending it back.

So in your `/unit_02/w06d04/student_labs` folder, you should see a starter application named `starter-code-hbs` with a bunch of work done already to get us going.

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO: PART 1 - Starter Code Set-up**

1. `cd` into `starter-code-hbs` and run the command `npm install` which will read the `package.json` file and install all of the dependencies specified in a `node_modules` folder. 

2. Then, run `nodemon server.js` to start our server.

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/SNHzqDp.png)

    In `server.js`, notice that we have a `/todos` route. It contains `var seededTodos` which is an array of 2 seeded todos:

    ```js
/* INDEX */
app.get('/todos', function(req,res) {
      var seededTodos = [
        {
          description: "get beer",
            urgent: true
          }, {
            description: "dry cleaning",
            urgent: false
          }
      ];
        
      res.render('/todos/index', {
        todos: seededTodos
      });
})
``` 


3. Walk back thorough yesterday's Express Router lesson and refactor this app with the following:

    - A `controllers/todos.js` file
    - Move your `/todos` route to the file.


<br>


&#x1F535; **YOU DO - PART 2**

1. Check out the `views/todos/index.hbs` file. Using Handlebars, add some code that shows us how many todos we have. Like so: 

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/4VhZNh3.png)

1. Add a 3 (or more) todos to the `seededTodos` object.

<br>

## module.exports

In `server.js`, we have a `var seededTodos` which is an array of 2 seeded todos.

As our app grows in size and complexity, we'll want to move logic out of our `server.js` file. One method for doing so is by using an object called `module.exports`. This allows us to clean up and share code throughout our app.

`module.exports` allows us to separate our js files by exposing their contents
as one global variable. The global variable isn't assigned until we require the
file.

1. For example, let's remove the `seededTodos` data from `controllers/todos.js` to our `data.js` file by adding it as a property to `module.exports` like so:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
     seededTodos: [
        {
          description: "get beer",
          urgent: true
        }, {
          description: "dry cleaning",
          urgent: false
        }
     ]
    };
```

    Now our `module.exports` will have a property of `seededTodos` which is an Array of todo objects.

1. In `controllers/todos.js`, instantiate a variable to grant access to module we've created:

    ```js
var data = require('../data.js');
```

1. Now, our variable `data` is our `module.exports` object. We can access our `seededTodos` via our `controllers/todos.js` file like so:
    
    ```js
    res.render('todos/index.hbs', {
       todos: data.seededTodos
    });
```
    > This is essentially like calling `module.exports.data`


    > Refresh the page and you can see that nothing changed in our browser, really we just moved the functionality into a different file. What advantages does that bring to us with regard to separation of concerns in MVC?

You'll start to see the necessity of `module.exports` once we add
models and more routes to our application.  Keeping everything in `server.js` will quickly become a headache.

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Add `module.exports` to your app to DRY up your code.

<br>


## Get To Know The Code - REST-ful Routing

In general, programming is very free form — there are many solutions and many possible and perfectly acceptable answers and means of solving problems. However, `Express` is a framework and has opinions about how we should write our code. Similarly, over the last 20 years or so programmers have developed several patterns to help clarify the purpose and design of routes in the context of HTTP and databases.

Our key words here today are:

- **RESTful** routes
- **CRUD**

|   HTTP 	| CRUD   	| RESTful View names        	|
|-------:	|--------	|---------------------------	|
| GET    	| Read   	| show / index / new / edit 	|
| POST   	| Create 	| no views rendered         	|
| UPDATE 	| Update 	| no views rendered         	|
| DELETE 	| Delete 	| no views rendered         	|

<br>

We're going to follow a very specific pattern at first.

|           View 	| Purpose                                                                    	| Blog example                                            	| RESTful route example                             	|
|---------------:	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---------------------------------------------------------	|---------------------------------------------------	|
| show.hbs  	| Shows a individual resource                                                	| A page that shows a single blog post                    	| localhost:3000/posts/1 | GET /posts/:id           	|
| index.hbs 	| Shows all instances of a resource                                          	| A page that shows all blog posts                        	| localhost:3000/posts | GET /posts                 	|
| new.hbs   	| Displays a form to create a new resource (form makes a post request)       	| A page that lets you create a new blog post            	| localhost:3000/posts/new | GET /posts/new             	|
| edit.hbs  	| Displays a form that lets you edit a resource (form makes a post request) 	| A page that lets you edit an already created blog post 	| localhost:3000/posts/1/edit | GET /posts/:id/edit 	|



<br>


Roughly, here's how the table above would look in our `server.js` (this generic example is BEFORE DRY-ing up our code with express.Router and a separate controller file.):

```javascript
app.get('/posts', function(req, res) {
  console.log("index");
  res.render("/posts/index");
});

app.get('/posts/new', function(req, res) {
  console.log("new");
  res.render('/posts/new');
});

app.get('/posts/:id', function(req, res) {
  console.log("show");
  res.render("/posts/show");
});

app.post('/posts', function(req, res) {
  console.log("create");
  res.send("CREATE");
});

app.get('/posts/:id/edit', function(req, res) {
  console.log("edit");
  res.render("/posts/edit");
});

app.put('/posts/:id', function(req, res) {
  console.log("update");
  res.send("UPDATE");
});

app.delete('/posts/:id', function(req, res) {
  console.log("delete");
  res.send("DELETE");
});
```
<br>

<details>
    <summary>**Nested Resources**</summary>

A restful architecture specifies the path to be constructed as a resource, the unique identifier of that resource and then another resource.

That second resource might be another object like a blog post or it might be a page.

So if we had users in our blog example above and users had blog posts and we wanted to see all of the blog posts of a specific user our route would like as follows:

`localhost:3000/users/1/posts` | `/users/:id/posts` | `views/posts/index.hbs` (file path)

Don't worry about this idea of nested resources for now, but know this is where we're moving toward.
</details>
<br>


## Todo `SHOW` Route 

Convention dictates that the `show` route returns one instance of of a given resource.

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Using what we learned about "wildcard" params (e.g. - `http://localhost:3000/:id`), see if you can create a route and a view to render a single todo from our `data.seededTodos` array. For example:

![](https://i.imgur.com/xOpoMui.png)

<br>

<details>
    <summary>**SOLUTION**</summary>
Route

```js
/* SHOW TODO */
router.get('/:id', function(req,res) {
  var todo = data.seededTodos[req.params.id];

  res.render('todos/show', {
    todo: todo
  });
});
```

Sample `views/todos/show.hbs` template

```html
<h1>Todo - {{todo.description}}</h1>
<p>Urgent: {{todo.urgent}}</p>
```
</details>

<br>


## Todo `NEW` Route 

Forms take user input and save it to a database, so let's start with a form to make a new todo item, as we need todos in our database.


Based on our table earlier. What view name do we want to use to create a page that has a form that will allow us to make a new resource?


1. Let's create a view for our form:  `touch views/todos/new.hbs`

2. Inside of `/todos/new.hbs` add the html form tags:

    ```html
<form>
</form>
```

    Now, forms need to know where to _send_ information and the HTTP verb they'll be using to submit a request. Which verb do we use to **create** a new resource?

    `POST`
    
    What's the route we need to `POST` to?

    `http://localhost:3000/todos`


    All forms must have a `method` and an `action`.


1. Add method and action attributes to our form. The value of method will be `POST` and the value of action will `/todos`

    ```html
<form method="POST" action="/todos">
</form>
```

    Now we've got a form that's going to `POST` to `/todos` – it'll hit our server, find an action with that combination of URL & verb, and run that code.

    There are no input fields or a submit button, but we'll add that next.
    
<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Walk through the steps above to add a basic skeleton form to your app.

<br>

#### Let's add some form fields!

Luckily, form fields aren't that different from something we've seen before in JS – an object. In an object there are keys & values. Each input in a form is a key/value pair. Let's see a semi-complete example & dissect it.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/todos">
  
  <label for="description">description:</label>
  <input name="description">
  
  <label for="urgent">urgent: </label>
  <span>yes</span><input type='radio' name='urgent' value="true" checked> 
  <span>no</span><input type='radio' name='urgent' value="false"/> 
  
</form>
```

The `name` attribute contains our key. What the user types into the text field or selects as a radio button is our `value`. This would get parsed server side as:

```js
req.body = {
    description: 'whatever the user wrote in the input box',
    urgent: 'true'
}
```

So if you did send that over, how would you access the entire todo object (i.e.- the form body itself)?

`req.body`

How would you access the todo's description?

`req.body.description`


#### How to send information in a form!

To submit a form we need a submit button. But you know the designer's rule – never submit, always something specific. Plus, let's encapsulate our label/input combos with some `divs` to get some grouping going on.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/todos">
   <div>
      <label for="description">description:</label>
      <input name="description">
   </div>
   <div>
      <label for="urgent">urgent: </label>
      <span>yes</span><input type='radio' name='urgent' value="true" checked> 
      <span>no</span><input type='radio' name='urgent' value="false"/> 
   </div>
   <div>
      <input type="submit" value="Add To-Do">
   </div>
</form>
```

Boom! Form, done.

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Finish fleshing out your form with the code above.

<br>

#### Server Side

Some of the the `controllers/todos.js` (specifically an INDEX route to show all of our todos, which we're storing in an array and our server/express configuration) is already written for you in the `starter-code`, we should walk through it to reiterate how it works.

```javascript
// controllers/todos.js

// This pulls in the module.exports object from 
// data.js and assigns it to var data
// specifically it contains our seeded todos
var data = require('../data.js');


// Index shows all of a specific resource
// INDEX TODOS - returns All todos
router.get('/', function(req,res) {
  res.render('todos/index.hbs', {
    todos: data.seededTodos
  });
});
```

<br>


## Rendering `new.hbs`

Remember, the *new* action is just there to render the form to allow us to create a new Todo. The _form_ is the part saying "when you hit enter/hit my button, I'm going to POST to `/todos`!"

> NOTE: If you have errors, be mindful of our discussion about why order matters when creating Express routes.

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

We have our `views/todos/new.hbs` file that includes the form. Now write a NEW route to render it. Refer to the table earlier to determine what structure the path should have.



<details>
    <summary>New Todo Route Solution</summary>
    
```js
/* NEW TODO */
router.get('/new', function(req, res){
  res.render('todos/new');
});
```
</details>

## Review

I'm gonna assign you a question and a breakout room. Answer your question first, then work on the others. We'll come back and each group will explain the answer to your assigned question.

1. What does `CRUD` stand for? What are the 4 HTTP verbs that we're using to accomplish this?
3. What does REST stand for? What does it mean for our app to be stateless? How many REST-ful routes are in a conventional CRUD application?
4. Which REST-ful routes have views associated with them? What do they all have in common?
5. Assume an `actor` resource and a `views/actors/` directory. Create an INDEX route. The response object will return a view containing `{ data: actors }`.
1. Assume an `actor` resource and a `views/actors/` directory. Create a NEW route. The response will return a view.
2. Create a form to create a new instance of an `actor`. The form will contain `name` and `mostRecentFilm` fields
3. Explain `module.exports` and why we use it.
4. Explain `require()` and why we use it.

<br>


## Todo `CREATE` Route

Awesome so now we have a form that renders on the page. So let's engage in some Error driven development. What happens when we add data and click the submit button?

![](https://i.imgur.com/QyawZUf.png)

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Build a todo CREATE route using `router.post`. Don't worry about accessing the params from the form yet. Just send a response back ("Create a new todo is working!") to the client so you can verify the route works.

<details>
    <summary>Create Todo Route Solution</summary>
    
```js
/* CREATE TODO */
router.post('/', function(req, res){
  res.send("Create a new todo is working!");
});
```
</details>

<br>

## Receiving parameters from forms

So what happens when we hit submit? The request is made and we can see that the correct route is getting hit. 

Up until now, how have we passed data/information from the client to server?

Forms send data inside of what we call the **body** of a request (rather than inside `params` or `queries`).

**GET** requests only send headers.

**POST** requests will send a header, and the parameters get sent in the body.

By default, Express doesn't have the ability to read the body sent by POST requests so we need to `npm install` another package.


<br>

## Install `body-parser`

`body-parser` (https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser), is a library that parses the body of incoming POST requests and stores the data as a key value pair on our `req` argument.

We access it via the `body` property.

#### moar configuration

1. Install body-parser using npm

    ```bash
$ npm install --save body-parser
```

    Remember this npm command will fetch the module in question, install it on our server, and load it into our `package.json`

1. Then inside our `server.js` we need to `require()` the module and configure it.

    ```javascript
    var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
        extended: true
    }));
```
    The params passed with a request will be "decoded" automatically, allowing you to use dot notation when working with JavaScript objects! The `extended: true` makes the objects more JSON-like.
    
1. In our `.post` route, change `res.send("Create working");` to `res.send(req.body);`

Now what happens when we submit a form?

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Install `body-parser` in your app.


<br>

## What is middleware?

You might have noticed that we just used a slightly different method than we have in the past (`.use`). We've used `app.listen()` and `app.set()` so far and now we've used `app.use(bodyParser...`

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Take ten minutes to read about middleware http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

**What kind of middleware is body-parser?**

---


Middleware is simply code that can be executed anywhere between a request and a response.

In our app we are logging out the server port once it has started - that is it. We get no other information about requests or errors. This is where Middleware comes in.

For an example, Let's write some middleware code that logs the type of request for any route that matches `/user`. We're gonna use a third-party library that's already required in the starter-app (`morgan`).

```javascript
app.use('/user/*', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  next();
});
```

The `next()` is a function built into express, which will, when evoked, move on to the next function in the chain. In this case it explicitly means to continue with the request/response cycle and call the appropriate route based on the request.

<br>

## Use `body-parser`

Body-parser is third-party middleware. It will:

- add a `body` property to our `req` object
- parse the body of the incoming request, if there is one
- add the data as the value of `req.body`

Now the form data is accessible via `req.body`. Our next step is to add our todo to the array.

<br>

&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

1. Complete the `.post` route so that it saves the value of `req.body` to our array. 
2. Use `res.redirect('/todos')` to redirect the route to the INDEX route rather than using `res.render(file)`

<details>
    <summary>Todo create route Solution</summary>
    
```js
/* CREATE TODO */
router.post('/', function(req, res){
    var newTodo = {
        description: req.body.description,
        urgent: req.body.urgent
    };

    data.seededTodos.push(newTodo);
    // res.send("Create a new todo is working!");
    res.redirect('/todos');
});
```

</details>

Why do we need to redirect after a `.post` action?


<br>

## LABTIME

1. Build a SHOW route (`/todos/:id`) that will render individual todos in a  `show.hbs` view. **Break it down...**
    - First, get the route working. Test it out by using `res.send("Show route is working")` 
    - Then, build a view and get it to `render` with `<h1>Show Route</h1>`
    - Finally, add the code to display the todo. For example:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Bi2U4Lw.png)

2. Add a nav bar to your layout view with links to your INDEX (`/todos`) and NEW(`/todos/new`) routes. For example:


       ![](https://i.imgur.com/32xDLQF.png)

3. Make each todo on the INDEX page clickable (hint: use anchor tags) so that each individual todo, when clicked, will link to it's correct show page (like the image above).

4. If there are no todos, the index page will display a `<p> you have no todos </p>`. (Hint #1: look up conditionals in the Handlebars documentation, Hint #2: You'll probably have to remove the `seededTodos` in `data.js` to test this out)

5. Add an external stylesheet and javascript files to the app (check out the Express Views lesson).

6. Add a `location` field to the seeded todos and the form.

7. Create separate sections on your INDEX page for urgent and non-urgent todos.

6. Create a view for your Home/Root route. 

1. Build INDEX, SHOW, NEW, and CREATE routes for a movie resource. Give each movie title and viewed fields

<summary>**RECAP: ClientSide**</summary>

## CLIENT vs SERVER

Data is sent from the client to the server, (from our browser to our express app). In the browser, we use HTML forms as an easy, user-friendly way to set up the write structure for muggles using our website.

This way our users can create new todos and update our database without any knowledge of http, routes, javascript, arrays or any of it really! The submit button is a one stop shop that as we've now learned triggers a whole series of processes.


## The form

It's just an html element that allows us to define how we want the data to be sent. The various attributes we configure let us set where the data is sent when the button is triggered. Remember how in our last unit we wanted to preventDefault behavior when the button was clicked? No longer, let that default behavior run free!

#### action form attribute

The action attribute is _essential_, it configures what route to send the data in the form to. In our example above that's to `/todos` but could be anything we want. if we had a song storage app that route might be `/songs`, if we had a ufo sightings database it might be `/sightings`

#### method form attribute

The method attribute refers to which HTTP verb we want to use. As you'll see tomorrow this can get a little hairy with PUT and DELETE, but today we're just specifying that it needs to be a POST request. Why is it not _essential_ like the action attribute is? Because the form will always default to making a GET request to whatever route is set in the action attribute.


## POST vs GET

You might remember that we sent all kinds of data to the server on Tuesday using our :dynamic_segments and query parameters using GET requests. So why don't we just use that method to add ToDos? Semantics.

A GET request, is specifically used by the browser to ask for some resource, an image, a song, a todo, etc, and use the data appended in the url to augment that request.

POST requests are specifically used to create a resource on the server.


POST requests send their data in the body, hidden from the user

The http request looks like this

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: /todos
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 36

description=take%20out%20the%20trash

```

# RECAP: Server Side

## Routes

Routes are defined in server.js and when the server is running, they listen for incoming HTTP requests on the specified PORT

the basic route syntax looks as follows:

```javascript

app.method('/route', function(req, res) {
  // the code that needs to run when this route is called  
})

```

## req vs res

#### req argument

The `req` argument is an object that contains information about the incoming HTTP request:

- req.route
- req.query
- req.params
- req.body (see bodyParser below)

#### res argument

the `res` argument is another object that contains information about the response we want to send to the server.

We initially started with using res.send to just send text to the browser, when using ejs however, we can use res.render to render an html/ejs file.

We can also use res.redirect to trigger another route before sending a response back to the browser

## bodyParser

Express is a very lightweight framework and doesn't have the functionality to read data sent in the body of POST requests without including this module of code.

Configuring bodyParser on our server adds the `body` property to our `req` object so that we can easily access parameters sent by POST requests

you configure it as follows after installing the module to our application

```bash
$ npm install body-parser --save
```

```javascript
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

<summary>**Set-up Solution**</summary>


# Set-up Solution


These routes are all related to todos.  Let's put them in a separate "controller" file and directory.  Create a a "controllers" directory and create a file called `todos.js`.  This will be our todos controller file.

Now move the routes pertaining to todos into that todos.js file.

```javascript
/* INDEX TODOS */
app.get('/todos', function(req,res) {
  var seededTodos = [
    {
      description: "get beer",
      urgent: true
    }, {
      description: "dry cleaning",
      urgent: false
    }
  ];

  res.render('todos/index', {
    todos: seededTodos
  });
});
```

Require express at the top of that `todos.js` file

```javascript
var express = require('express');
```

invoke the router

```javascript
var router = express.Router();
```

Change app to router

```javascript
/* INDEX TODOS */
router.get('/todos', function(req,res) {
  ...
});
```

At the bottom of the file, export the router

```javascript
module.exports = router;
```

Now in your `server.js`, require the controller file we created.  **Be sure to include ./ at the beginning of the path to the controller, so node knows that this is not an NPM package.**

```javascript
var todosController = require('./controllers/todos.js');
```

Use the controller for all routes that start with `/todos`

```javascript
app.use('/todos', todosController);
```

Since we are specifying that the controller will be used for all routes starting with `/todos`, we don't need to show `/todos` in our actual routes within our controller file.

```javascript
/* INDEX TODOS */
router.get('/', function(req,res) {
  ...
});
```
