To make a GET request:

```bash
$ curl <url>

```

1. Make a get request to http://www.google.com
  
  a. Take a couple minutes to read through the response in your terminal.
  
2. Make a get request to the url of your unit 1 project.
  
  a. Take five minutes to read through the response in your terminal.

3. Make the same requests but this time use the `--head` flag before the url. This will only show you the response header from your request, without the content.

> **HTTP headers** allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. - MDN

4. Read the HTTP Messages section of the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#HTTP_Messages)

5. Skim the Status Codes section of the [HTTP documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

What status code do you see in the headers that you received from your two requests?
