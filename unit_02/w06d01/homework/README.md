# Homework : Intro to Node

![image](http://thisdavej.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nodejs-logo.png)

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-...` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

#### Exercise Objectives

- gain practice  installing `npm` packages (globally & locally) on terminal
- gain practice executing code with self-guided reading of documentation
- gain familiarity with popular packages on [npmjs's official site](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- introduce [Express](http://expressjs.com/), a web app framework



### Part 1 : Globally installing a package with npm
#### Directions
- Globally install the  [cowsay](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cowsay) `npm` package (you can run this in any directory)
- Read the documentation for cowsay and give the cow a unique message through terminal
- Select an option from `cowsay -h` to modify your cow, and run another unique message
- Take a screenshot of your terminal output and add that image to your homework folder

*Example Output*

<details><summary>.. Stuck?</summary>
- Did you properly install `cowsay` using `npm install cowsay -g`?
- You can check you have successfully installed it if typing `cowsay` in terminal doesn't return an error
- to add a modification on your cow, use `cowsay -h` for a list of options. Select your choice, and add that tag (ie. -p, -s, -t) to your `cowsay` command in terminal

</details>


### Part 2: Make a command line app
#### Directions
- create a `pirate_jokes` folder to the current `homework` directory
- `cd` into that folder
- run `npm init`
  - press "enter" to go through all of the prompts you'll get in the terminal

*Requiring Node Modules*
 -  Locally install the [node-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier) package to `pirate_jokes`
 -  Touch a `main.js` file in your `pirate_jokes` directory
 -  Type the following code in `main.js` and save it:

```js
//require notifier package
var notifier = require('node-notifier');

//create notifier object
notifier.notify({
  'title': 'Joke of the Day',
  'message': 'Q: How much did the pirate pay for his piercings? \nA: A buck-an-ear.'
});
```

 -  Run your file by typing `node main.js` into the terminal
 -  git add, and git commit with the message: "successful pirate joke"

<details><summary>.. Stuck?</summary>
 - If you get an error message that says "module not found", double check that you installed the library correctly with `npm install node-notifier`. You can verify the library was successfully installed if running `node-notifier` in terminal returns no errors.

 - Syntax error? If you typed out the code, double check your syntax with the provided example. Did you remember to require the package?

 -  Nothing happens with `node main.js`? Double check your running it in the correct (current working) directory.
</details>

### Part 3: A closer look at npm packages
- Take a look at npm's [most starred packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star) on the npmjs website
- Record your answers to the following questions in the `node_answers.md` file **
  1. What are the top 6 highest-starred npm packages? (Hint: reduce the browser width to see a better list view)
  2. Describe what the package is, in a few words or sentences (you may have to refer to the original documentation listed under each links' description).
  3. How many downloads did this package have in the last month?
- git add, and commit with the message "closer look at npm packages"

Example:

> ** Note: your answers will be in markdown format. For markdown syntax guidelines, you can refer to this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).



#### Reach Goals
Starting tomorrow we will dive into [Express](http://expressjs.com/), which we will use to build web applications. You have seen it is the highest-starred library with millions of downloads. Try to familiarize yourself with the site and documentation (listed under "GUIDE"), and keep these questions in mind:
  - What is Node versus Express?
  - What is their relationship?
  - "Fast, unopinionated, minimalist" -- what do those words mean?

## Submitting Your Work

  When you're ready to submit your work,

  1.  Add, commit, and push your code to your fork of the class repo.
  2.  File an issue on the class repo titled "Your Name -- wXXdXX".

  The issue should include:

  -   A link that points back to your fork.

  -   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very
      uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
