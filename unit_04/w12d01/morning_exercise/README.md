# Front End Frameworks: CSS

This morning you will explore a CSS framework. Remember, a framework is basically a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS). These frameworks help give our websites **structure** and **reusable code**, because.. why re-invent the wheel?

There are 2 types of CSS frameworks: simple ones and complete ones. Simple frameworks are essentially responsive grid systems, whereas complete frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) offer a wide suite of features such as templating. Both types have their pros and cons, but overall, these frameworks are pretty simple to set up and are all very complete.

**Technical language requirements**
Experience with these frameworks will satisfy front-end development positions that require knowledge in:
- Front end frameworks (obviously..)
- Experience with CSS Preprocessors
- Responsive and Mobile Design
- Creating beautiful interfaces

Here are some popular front-end frameworks (minimal* and complete**):

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/): Most popular**
- [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html): Very popular**
- [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/)*
- [Bulma.io](http://bulma.io/)*
- [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)*
- [Semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/)*
- [Milligram](https://milligram.github.io/)*
