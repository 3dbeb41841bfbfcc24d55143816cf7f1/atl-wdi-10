There are a couple ways to run your code in ruby. They should feel mostly familiar.

The key distinction between Ruby and JS is that Ruby does not run in the browser. Period.

It is purely a server side language.

## require and require_relative

You can require the code from a file using the require method or the require_relative method.

These methods take a file path as an argument.

`require` takes an absolute path
`require_relative` takes a relative path


You can run your code in your repl using pry.

Or by writing it in a ruby file and running it from the terminal

$`ruby my_ruby_file.rb`
