# HW Reading: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

[POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) (pronounced "pooder") explains object-oriented design (OOD) in Ruby. Javascript is an object-oriented language but it is not class-based like it is in Ruby, Java, C++, C, etc.. POODR was written by Sandi Metz, a software developer and author focused on writing flexible object-oriented code in Ruby and Rails.
