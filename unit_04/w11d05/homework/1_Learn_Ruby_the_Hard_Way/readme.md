# HW : Learn Ruby the Hard Way

## What is Ruby?

Ruby is a programming language that was created in the mid-90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto (better known in the Ruby community as "Matz"). Ruby and JavaScript
share a number of similarities, but also a number of differences.

["Learn Ruby the Hard Way"](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book), by Zed Shaw, is one of the most well-known tutorials for beginners to learn Ruby
(in part because it is hosted for free online, woohoo!).

## Directions

You will read through the follow lessons and complete the "Study Drills" at the end of each reading. I recommend you watch the videos listed as well to get a video summary of the material.

Inside `ruby_study_drills` you will create your ruby files and exercises in here. If you get stuck too long, create a bug report, and can move on to the next chapter. When you run your scripts make sure you're in the correct directory.

** denotes that chapter is read only, no drills involved

:dart: Commit after each exercise.

## Closing Questions

Please answer the following questions in the spaces provided.

1.  How do you write an `if` statement in Ruby?

2.  Please write code that would take the string "007", reverse it,
    and return the integer `700`.

  ```ruby
    # your answer here
  ```

3.  Please write code that takes the array `[23,56,3,7]`, sorts it,
    and then reverses that sorted array 'in place'
    (i.e. modifying the original array, rather than returning a new array).

  ```ruby
