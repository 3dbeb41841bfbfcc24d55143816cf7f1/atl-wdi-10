## Submitting Your Work

  When you're ready to submit your work,

  1.  Add, commit, and push your code to your fork of the class repo.
  2.  File an issue on the class repo titled "Your Name -- wXXdXX".

  The issue should include:

  -   A link that points back to your fork.

  -   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very
      uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
