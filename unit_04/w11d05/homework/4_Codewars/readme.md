# CodeWars: Look Ma, No Hands!

In Units 1, 2, and 3, you were tasked with completing a number of CodeWars kata
as morning exercises and homework. In your homework tonight, you will need to
solve some of those same problems again... _in **Ruby**_.

Try each of the following CodeWars exercises in Ruby; when you
complete each exercise, add your solution code to the appropriate file in this
directory.

-   [Remove String Spaces](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-string-spaces/train/ruby)
-   [How Many Consecutive Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/how-many-consecutive-numbers-are-needed/ruby)
-   [FizzBuzz Cuckoo Clock](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fizz-buzz-cuckoo-clock/train/ruby)
-   [What dominates your array?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/what-dominates-your-array/train/ruby)

Feel free to try these out in javascript and refactor back to Ruby. That said, you can also start from scratch if
you want the additional challenge.
