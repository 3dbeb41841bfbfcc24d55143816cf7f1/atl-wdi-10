# Exercise: Quick N' Dirty Grocery App

## Directions

Write a small command line program in `groceries.rb` that:

1. Prompts the user with **"X groceries so far. Enter another grocery item, or type 'done'"**, and then accept an input string from them.
2. Each grocery item gets stored in a `groceries` array.
3. When the user enters `done`, the program ends and prints the following outcomes:
    * **"You have X groceries on your list."**
    * **"The groceries are: item1, item2, item3"**


#### Example Outputs:
