# Exercise: Dirty Words

In this day and age, what you say online can have major repercussions if you don't filter your language! We'll create a little program that helps us stop dirty words from being published online.  

## Directions

Write a small command line program in `dirty_words.rb` that:

1. Prompts the user with **"Go ahead, say your worst:"**, and then accept an input sentence from them.
2. Convert their sentence to an array of words.
3. Check if any of their words are flagged as dirty words (listed below).
4. Print one of the following outcomes:
    * **"We're rejecting that, ya filthy animal."**
    * **"Okay, we'll publish that."**

```
dirty_words = ['filth', 'dirt', 'grime', 'mess', 'dust', 'muck', 'gunk', 'poop', 'soil', 'crud', 'slime']

```
