&#x1F535; **YOU DO**

Take 5 minutes and read through this article: https://www.upwork.com/hiring/data/sql-vs-nosql-databases-whats-the-difference/

Note the differences between a SQL (e.g.- Postgres) and a No-SQL database (e.g.- Mongo).

### SQL vs NoSQL comparison

| SQL | NoSQL |
| --- | ----- |
| Since late 1970s | Since late 2000s |
| Relational model | other data storage models |
| Tables (rows and columns) | Documents (js objects) |
| not easy to scale | easier to scale |
| reliability, [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliance | no promises :) |
| **Examples** Postgres, MySQL, SQLite | **Examples** MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase |


> ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that ensure data is reliably stored.


## What's a Relational Database? (10 minutes / 0:50)

<!-- AM: Whiteboard a table(s) during this section. -->

The most popular type of database is a **relational** database. How do they work?

![SQL tables](./images/sql-is-fun.jpg)

*Tabular!*

**Data is stored in tables**

- These tables are organized by columns and rows, much like a spreadsheet.
- Tables are named according to what they model (e.g., `authors`, `books`).
- In the case of `authors`, each row represents one author.
- Each column is called an **attribute** or **field**, such as `id`, `title`, `birth_year`.

**Communicate via SQL (Structured Query Language)**

- SQL is a database language used specifically for relational databases.
- This is in contrast to non-relational databases (we've used Mongo) which is essentially Javascript
 
**Can relate data between tables**

- Hence the name *relational* database.
- We can relate rows in the `books` table to rows in the `authors` table.
- We use a `key` to do this, which is a field that is unique for each row in a table. 
- The key is often represented using an `id`, which is a unique identifier for each entry in a table. We refer to this as a `primary_key`.
- For example, to relate a book to an author we'd add a `foreign_key` field of `author_id` to our songs table. The `author_id` would be the `primary_key` (or `id`) of the author the book belongs to.

### Types of Relational Databases

There are lots of relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
They are all similar in that they use SQL, but they do have different features.

MySQL claims to be "the most popular open-source database," while PostgreSQL
claims in response to be "the most advanced open-source database". It's true
that in most tests, Postgres comes out ahead in terms of speed and has many
features MySQL lacks, such as true full-text search and handling geo-data.

If you're interested in pros and cons, check out this [article comparing MySQL,
Postgres, and SQLite](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems).

### Terminology

While this is a bit technical, it's worth clarifying some terminology...

* **Database** - The actual set of data being stored. We may create multiple
  databases on our computer, usually one for each application.
* **Database Language** - The language used to interact with a database. With relational databases, that is SQL.
* **Database Management System** - The software that lets a user interact (query)
  the data in a database. Examples are PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
* **Database CLI** - A tool offered by most DBMSs that allows us to query the
  database from the command line. For PostgreSQL, we'll use `psql`. For Mongo, we used `mongo`.
  
## Install Postgres

[Install Postgres Doc](getting_postgres.md) 

## Exploring Postgres (15 minutes / 1:05)

Note: We are learning this to be able to read it. We'll look stuff up when we want to write it!

But there have been times GA grads need to use it (4 months later)!
![SQL](./images/screenshot_kibble.png)

Start by spotlight searching (`command-space`) for Postgres and launching `Postgres.app`. Once you see the elephant in your Mac menu bar, you'll know Postgres is running.

### psql commands

We'll use `psql` as our primary means of interacting with our databases. Later
on we'll use ruby or server-side JS programs to do so in our programs.

Here's a quick demo. Following along is optional.

```sql
help -- show psql general help info
\?   -- help with psql commands
\h   -- help with SQL commands
\l   -- Lists all databases

CREATE DATABASE demodb;

# What changed?
\l

-- What happens if we don't use a semicolon?


\c demodb -- Connect to the database

\d -- Lists all tables

CREATE TABLE pokemon (
  number INT UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR
);

\d

\d+ tablename
-- To view the schema for a table
```
#### CRUD

```sql
SELECT * FROM pokemon;
-- nothing!


INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name) VALUES (001, 'Bulbasaur');
-- This won't work! Why?


INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (001, 'Bulbasaur', 'Grass');
SELECT * FROM pokemon;

-- INSERT worked! Let's add more
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (002, 'Ivysaur', 'Grass');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (003, 'Venusaur', 'Grass');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (004, 'Charmander', 'Fire');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (005, 'Charmeleon', 'Ghost');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (006, 'Charizard', 'Fire');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (007, 'Squitle', 'Water');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (008, 'Wartortle', 'Water');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (009, 'Blastoise', 'Water');
INSERT INTO pokemon (number, name, type) VALUES (025, 'Pikachu', 'Electric');

-- READ
SELECT * FROM pokemon;


-- UPDATE
UPDATE pokemon SET type = 'Fire' WHERE number = 5;
-- UPDATE pokemon SET name=...


-- DELETE
DELETE FROM pokemon WHERE name = 'Pikachu';


-- DROP deletes tables and databases
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pokemon;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS demodb;

\q --quit
```

In short...

- Backslash commands (e.g. `\l` ) are commands to navigate psql. These are psql-specific.
- Everything else is SQL. The SQL is what actually interacts with the database.

### SQL Syntax

- All statements end in a semicolon.
- Whitespace doesn't matter.
- Uppercasing! (Lowercase works, but the convention is Uppercase)
- Always use single quotes when typing out string values.

## BREAK (10 minutes / 1:15)

## Schema (10 minutes / 1:25)

Every application's database will have one or more tables. You will recall, each table stores information about a particular model (e.g., `authors`, `books`).

Each table has a **schema**, which defines what columns it has. For each column the schema defines...

- The column's name.
- The column's data type.
- Any constraints for that column.

### Common Data Types

Here are some common data types for SQL DBs. They are all, for the most part, things you've seen before...

- Boolean
- Integer
- Float
- Text / VARCHAR
  - VARCHAR is short, TEXT is long
- NULL
- Date
- Time

> [And many more...](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/datatype.html)

### Constraints

Constraints act as limits on the data that can go in a column.

- e.g., `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`.

> [And many more...](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/ddl-constraints.html)

### Example: Garnet

[Here's the super scary schema we use in Garnet.](https://github.com/ga-dc/garnet/blob/master/db/schema.rb) ðŸ˜±

![garnet_erd](images/Garnet_ERD.png)

### Defining a Schema

Next we're going to build a schema for a database in a sample application. It can change later on if we need to add / remove tables or columns, but we'll start with something simple.

Instead of typing this into psql, we're going to do so by saving the schema to a `.sql` file and run it, just like we have with `.js` and `.rb` files.

## You Do: Building Our DB (15 minutes / 1:40)

> 10 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

1. `cd` into the `library_sql` folder in student labs
2. Open it in atom.
3. Follow along with the directions below, running commands in the terminal.

#### Creating our Database

```bash
$ createdb library
```

Note that this is a command-line utility that ships with Postgres, as an
alternate to using the SQL command `CREATE DATABASE library;` inside `psql`.

#### Inspecting our Schema

Look critically at each line of the provided `schema.sql` file. Here's how one row breaks down...

`id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`

- `id`: column name, how we will refer to this column
- `SERIAL` is the data type (similar to integer or string).  It's a special datatype for unique identifier columns, which the db auto-increments.
- `PRIMARY KEY`: a special constraint which indicates a unique identifier for each row.

Take a few minutes to research the other rows.

#### Loading our Schema

To load our schema, we need to run our `schema.sql` file via the Terminal...

```bash
$ psql -d library < schema.sql
```

This means: "run the psql program, connect to the database called 'library',
then run the `schema.sql` file in that database".

> NOTE: from inside the `library` database in `psql` you could also run `library=# \i schema.sql`

#### Loading a Seed File

I've provided a sql file that adds sample data into our `library` database.

Load that in so we can practice interacting with our data:

```bash
$ psql -d library < seed.sql
```

#### Loading a CSV Seed File

I've provided a csv file that adds sample data into the `books` table of our `library` database.

First, enter into the library DB...

```bash
$ psql
$ \c library
```

#### Load a CSV file

We can load the `books.csv` file directly from `psql`:

```
library=# \copy books(title,publication_date,author_id) FROM 'books.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
```

<!-- AM: Is this where the "Building Our DB" exercise ends? -->

## Performing CRUD actions with SQL

CRUD stands for the most basic interactions we want to have with any database:
Create, Read, Update and Destroy.

The most common SQL commands correspond to these 4 actions...

* `INSERT` -> Create a row
* `SELECT` -> Read / get information for rows
* `UPDATE` -> Update a row
* `DELETE` -> Destroy a row

### Verb Equivalence

**[CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)**
_(create, read, update and delete)_, SQL, HTTP, and Rails Controller action.

| CRUD   | SQL    | HTTP   | action     |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-----------|
| Create | INSERT | POST   | create     |
| Read   | SELECT | GET    | index/show |
| Update | UPDATE | PATCH  | update     |
| Delete | DELETE | DELETE | destroy    |

First, enter into the library DB (if you aren't already)...

```bash
$ psql
$ \c library
```

### INSERT

`INSERT` adds a row to a table...

```sql
INSERT INTO authors(name, nationality, birth_year) VALUES ('Adam Bray', 'United States of America', 1985);
```

### SELECT

`SELECT` returns rows from a table...

```sql
-- select all columns from all rows
-- The result is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
SELECT * FROM authors;

-- select only some columns, from all rows
SELECT name, birth_year FROM authors;

-- select rows that meet certain criteria
SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name = 'James Baldwin';
```

### UPDATE

`UPDATE` updates values for one or more rows...

```sql
UPDATE authors SET name = 'Adam B.', birth_year = 1986 WHERE name = 'Adam Bray';
```

### DELETE

`DELETE` removes rows from a table...

```sql
DELETE FROM authors WHERE name = 'Adam B.';
```

## Exercise! (20 minutes / 2:00)

Complete the queries in `basic_queries.sql` in the library_sql repo.
