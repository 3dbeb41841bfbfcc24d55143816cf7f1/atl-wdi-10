# FizzBuzz

HINT: Use Ruby Range

1) Create a method that will count to 20.  It should `puts` each number on the terminal.
2) Now for every number divisible by 3, the method should `puts "Fizz"` instead of the number.
3) Now for every number divisible by 5, the method should `puts "Buzz"` instead of the number.
4) Now for every number divisible by 3 AND 5, the method should `puts "FizzBuzz"` instead of the number.
5) Refactor.



## Bonus

Use Ruby methods to clean up your code in the Shopping List lab! Each exercise in the Shopping List lab should have it's own method.  Don't forget to use instance variables to communicate values within and outside of methods.
