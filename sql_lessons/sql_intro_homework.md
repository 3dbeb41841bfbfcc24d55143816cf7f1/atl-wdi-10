### Pick one of your previous projects and re-build your database using SQL!

1. Create a `schema.sql` file that contains a schema for at least three models. 
If your project only had two, try to think of a third model that would fit your 
use case and how it would relate to the other two.

2. Draw an ERD for your schema.

3. Use SQL to manipulate your database! 
	- Write out the SQL statement to grab all data from one of your tables.
	- Write out the SQL statement to grab all data from ALL of your tables.
	- Write out the SQL statement to grab one column EACH from two of your tables.
	- Write out the SQL to update all values in one of your tables' columns;
	- Write out the SQL statement to update a specific value in one of your models.
