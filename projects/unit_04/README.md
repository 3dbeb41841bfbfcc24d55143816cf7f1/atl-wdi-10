### Overview

For your 4th project, you'll have the choice of building a MEAN stack app or a Rails + Angular app. Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. For this project, you can either work in a group or individually. We're leaving it up to you to form groups **Limit of 3 per group**.

You'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your
instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember
to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope
creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and
identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable
Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which reach goals to focus on for the
remainder of your time.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 3 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone
using your application (a user), and two that represent the main functional ideas
for your app
* **Have validations on any applicable fields on your models**
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST,
PUT, and DELETE
* **Use MongoDB or SQL for your database**
* **Use a third-party API** e.g. Google Maps for geolocation, or anything you want.
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include ERDs**
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* Have at least **100 lines of CSS** (not including whitespace)
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via Heroku

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application**, hosted on Heroku
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and
frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early,
commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach
was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your
project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publicly-accessible **user stories you created**

Most importantly a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is 5-10 minutes in length
* If working as a group, **ALL** group members should speak during the presentation
* Shows off all features of the app
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explain the pros/cons of the development stack you chose for this application.
* Explains which improvements you might make

### To Submit

* We will use **GAlaxy** to submit as a group Project. (https://ga-laxy.herokuapp.com/)

### Before you start creating your repo or coding.

Read [Git Collaboration Workflow](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Exercises/project-vagabond/blob/master/git-collaboration-workflow.md)

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with
wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a
tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is
crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can
always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your
application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get
done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their
perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of
something helps.

### Useful Resources

* **[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com)** _(for hosting your back-end)_
* **[Writing Good User Stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/)** _(for a few user story tips)_
* **[Presenting Information Architecture](http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/4-presenting-information.html)** _(for more insight into wireframing)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

# Project Week

## Attendance
You are required to be present by 10:00 am EDT each day during the project.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:15 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday
- What am i trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time_


## Where to go for help during project week
1. Google
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help from Sanjeev or Josh
