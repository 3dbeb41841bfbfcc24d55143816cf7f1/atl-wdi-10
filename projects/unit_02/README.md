# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack server application.** You will be **building a Node/Express App with Mongo/Mongoose,** which means that you will learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It is a lot, but we have given you the tools over the last few weeks to build what you need; you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you will be designing the app yourself. We hope you will exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app.

You will need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which reach goals to focus on for the remainder of your time.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application (a user), and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow. The boilerplate is here: https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum/atl-wdi-9/tree/master/projects/unit_02/project2_boilerplate
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Write Mongo queries using the Mongoose module** and interact with your document database. Promises will likely make your life easier as you start to build complex queries!
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include ERDs**
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via Heroku

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.  Make your commit messages descriptive.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the **PUBLICLY-accessible** **user stories you created/your trello board- with given, when, then statements for each story.**
* A link on your portfolio site to your project 2.

---

### To Submit

* **Create a GitHub issue on the class repo** with a link your Project Repo, and a link to Heroku where your project's deployed.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarklet
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Closet/Bookshelf Organizer

An application that helps users keep track of items in their closet or bookshelf.

Maybe users could loan books/clothes to friends and keep track of it in their database.

### Project 2 Readme Samples

- https://github.com/zarela/goal-tracker
- https://github.com/sanazjamloo/project2

Github `readme.md` files are written in a language called Markdown which is compiled into HTML. You'll be using this a lot so it's good to learn some simple syntax rules now.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Submit a Github issue **on the WDI-ATL** class Github account to receive help from an instructor

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for wdi-atl to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submiting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relavent code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
