​

# Winter Hols Project!

## Project due date
Your project is due at 10 am EDT on Monday January, 2nd.

**Monday, January 2nd**<br>
Submit an issue (as you normally do for homework) with a link to your repo AND a link to your live site if you were able to deploy it. You will be presenting your projects in front of the class on Monday!

## Make a new repo
Before you begin, make a new github repo for your project. **Do not** begin your project within the class repo.

## Attendance, expectations of time commitment

Typically students are required to be in class working on their project during regular class hours. And students continue to work on their project in the evening, dedicating the same amount of time if not more as they do on their homework.

This Unit project occurs during our Winter Holiday so there won't be attendance or manditory class time. However, in order to be successful you should set aside a solid 5-6 full days to commit to this project.

## Standups
We encourage you to hold student-run stand-ups in the mornings when you start working to help you all keep each other accountable and help each other out. When you start working each day, reach out on Slack and see if anyone is around to hold a standup!

Questions to answer during standup:

  - What did I work on yesterday?
  - What am I trying to get done today?
  - What is preventing me from getting this done?

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

**Monday, Dec 20th**
<br>
You will come with your choice of project, pseudo-code, wireframes and user stories

2. Seek out help with your buddy
3. Seek out help with your classmates
4. Submit GitHub issues to the repo and paste links in the debugging channel to ask for advice
5. Project tracker: link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F-JlNmi1u0Ajuqe0JcAX_Y5FYagpb89B47YvmOnvNtY/edit#gid=0)
6. Ask questions and communicate with your classmates over the Debugging Channel
7. Post to Stack Overflow, be sure to follow the format for submitting bug reports, provide lots of context!
## Formatting your GitHub Issue for wdi-remote to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submitting an issue and linking your classmates to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relavent code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
