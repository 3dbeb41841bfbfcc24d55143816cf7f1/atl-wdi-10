​

# Winter Hols Project!

## Project due date
Your project is due at 2 pm on Friday, March, 10th.

**Friday, March 10th**<br>
Submit a link to your repo AND a link to your live site if you were able to deploy it to Ga-laxy. You will be presenting your projects in front of the class on Friday!

## Make a new repo
Before you begin, make a new github repo for your project. **Do not** begin your project within the class repo.

## Attendance, expectations of time commitment

Typically students are required to be in class working on their project during regular class hours. And students continue to work on their project in the evening, dedicating the same amount of time if not more as they do on their homework.

## Standups
We encourage you to hold your stand-ups in the mornings when you start working to help you all keep each other accountable and help each other out. When you start working each day, reach out on Slack and see if anyone is around to hold a standup!

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

**Tuesday, March 7th**
<br />
You will come with your choice of project, pseudo-code, wireframes and user stories

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for atl-wdi-9 to ask for help

*COMMIT/PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submitting an issue and linking your classmates to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relevant code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
