​

# Project Week

## Project due date
Your project is due at 10 am EDT on Monday September 19th. 

**Monday, September 19**<br>
Submit an issue (as you normally do for homework) with a link to your repo AND a link to your live site. You will be presenting your projects in front of the class.

## Make a new repo
Before you begin, make a new github repo for your project. **Do not** begin your project within the class repo.

## Attendance
You are required to be present at 10:00 am EDT  and 2:30 pm EDT each day during the project. We will be taking attendance at these times.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:00 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:
- What did I work on yesterday
- What am I trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.


**Monday, Dec 20th **<br>
You will come with your choice of project, pseudo-code, wireframes and user stories

## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your buddy
3. Seek out help with your classmates
4. Submit GitHub issues to the repo and paste links in the debugging channel to ask for advice

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for wdi-remote to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submiting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relavent code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
