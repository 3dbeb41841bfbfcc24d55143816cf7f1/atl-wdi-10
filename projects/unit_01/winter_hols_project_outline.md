# First Weekend Project (2.5 days)

This asignment would be given Friday evening for students to complete over the weekend (Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, Pokemon Battle game, or something similar).

Meet with Partner (~5 hours)

Students will meet with their partner once after the first weekend asignment to go over both of their solutions, whether partial or complete. The end result of this meeting should be an attempt to have at least one working solution submitted by the group.

Traditional Unit 1 Game Project (blackjack or connect four) (5 days)

Same expectations as we've had for prior cohorts with the option of providing markdowns outlining requirements, which exist in the wdi-remote (panthalassa repo) caveat is that is a ton of hand-holding.

Reading (some number of hours)

Students can be assigned reading from Eloquent JS, Speaking JS, and/or JS the Good Parts

Code Wars (1hr 30m per)

Students should attempt to complete at least 1 CodeWars challenge from our curated list per day, with an expectation that students complete at least __ number by Jan 1.

Student support during the two weeks

Students would have a daily tracker provided by us to keep track of what they should have completed by each day that they can fill out
Students could be encouraged to meet regularly and possibly be required to meet at least once with their partner 
In assigning the first hw, reading, plus codewars even if the Unit 1 project is too much they're at least not completely down the creek without a paddle and have been able to complete some work
We could try to create an optional schedule for study groups. i.e. Suggest to students that in general they all make time at a similar time each day to work so at least at some points during the break students know there are other industrious souls slinging code like blacksmiths of ol'.

Student Workload
Following this breakdown students should have a full 8 days worth of work leaving them with a remaining 8 days of vacation time 


Possible Eventualities

Students present their game project Jan 2. If projects are super rough. The week could procede as usual, with the following Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon given to students to finish up the project, with presentations on Tuesday, instead of assigning the portfolio site.

Absolute worst case scenario, we add an extra week of JS and consider removing one of the three final projects from the end of the ccourse
