## FIRST WEEKEND PROJECT (2.5 DAYS)

This homework will be assigned Friday evening to complete over the weekend.

Submit a GitHub issue using the standard homework format *Monday morning.*

## Meet with your Partner (~5 hours)

You will meet with your week two buddy after the weekend assignment to go over both of your solutions, whether partial or complete. The result of this meeting should be an attempt to have at least one working solution submitted by the group.

One student from the group will submit another GitHub issue with a link to the updated assignment and notes about what the group talked about, problems solved, encountered, etc.

## CODE WARS (1HR 30M PER)

Complete at least 5 CodeWars challenge from our curated [list](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote-matey/blob/master/projects/unit_01/codewars_challenges.md) over the break, with an expectation that you will complete at least 5 by Jan 1.

I highly recommend you use these as a morning exercise to warm your brain up before you work on your project each day!

## Daily Structure recommendation

The work outlined in this document should take around 8 _full_ work days to complete so *_plan accordingly_*.

I recommend you structure day as follows:

- 9:00am: Spend about an hour and a half working on a code challenge. Can be on your own or with a partner.
- If other students are around on slack, hold a brief standup answering the following three questions:
  - What did you work on or finish yesterday?
  - What are you working on today?
  - What are you blockers? What is preventing you from getting that work done?
- 10:30am - 1:30: Work on your project or homework making sure to take a 5 - 10 minute break every hour.
- 1:30 - 2:20: LUNCH! Get out of your head, think about something else, see some sunlight, drink some eggnog!
- 2:30 - 6:30: Get back to your project, again remembering to take breaks!
- Take an hour or so for dinner
- If you have the energy spend another couple hours working on your projec.

Remember to sleep!
