# Homework : Function Drilling

<!-- MATERIALS METADATA -->
<!--
  title: Function Drilling
  format: homework
  duration: 4 hours
  original author: Matt Brendzel
  tags: javascript, functions, problem solving
-->

## Setup

Make sure that you are on the `master` branch of your `wdi-remote-matey` repo.
Then run `git pull upstream master` to pull the latest materials from the
instructors' repository. You shouldn't hit a merge conflict here, but if you do,
flag down an instructor right away.

Next, navigate to the directory for today, go into the `homework` directory, and
run `npm install` -- this will download any assignment-specific JavaScript
dependencies into to a directory called `node_modules`.

As you work through this assignment, you should make commits regularly.
In particular, since there are automated tests built into this assignment, we
recommend that you make a commit every time that you pass a new test, in
addition to any other time you feel might be appropriate (e.g. just before
trying out something new).

## Instructions

Read through `hw.js` and complete all of the functions listed there.

### Testing Your Work

A set of automated tests, written in the [Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/)
testing framework, has been provided for you with this assignment.
To run these tests, type `npm test` into the console from the root directory
of this repo. Test your work regularly, and read the feedback from the tests
carefully -- it may give you a clue about what to do next.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your work,

1.  Run the command `npm test` and take a screenshot of the output in your
    terminal.
2.  Push your code to your fork of the class repo.
3.  File an issue on the class repo titled "Your Name -- w01d04".

The issue should include:

-   A link that points back to your fork.

-   The screenshot you took.

-   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very
    uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
