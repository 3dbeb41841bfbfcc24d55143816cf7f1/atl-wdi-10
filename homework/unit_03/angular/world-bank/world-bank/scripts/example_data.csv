"Lao People's Democratic Republic","The objective of the Ninth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 9) Project for Lao People's Democratic Republic is to support policies and institutional reforms that enable the sustainable management of increasing revenues from the natural resource sectors to deliver improved public services. Five areas of priority, or policy areas, have been identified. First, better fiscal and financial management will enable policymakers to maximize benefits accruing from increased revenues from natural resources. Second, the revenue management framework in the hydropower and mining sectors should also be clearly defined to maximize revenues accruing over time to the government for development purposes while attracting good quality investment in the sector. Third, diversification of economic growth sources through a competitive private sector outside the resource sector is critical to ensure the sustainability of growth. As the natural resource sector is capital intensive, it does not provide abundant job opportunities, as opposed to manufacturing, agribusiness or services. Diversified sources of growth are also important to reduce vulnerability to developments and exogenous shocks in narrow set of sectors. Finally, the fourth and fifth priorities for translating increased revenues from the natural sectors into improved public service delivery are a strong public sector capable of managing these revenues effectively coupled with the establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms for schools and health facilities. PRSO 9 supports the establishment of a mining revenue committee and its reporting on fiscal regime policy issues and options in the sector.

"Solomon Islands","Solomon Islands are a fragile, post-conflict small island state and the poorest in the Pacific when measured in terms of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP per capita. Most of the population is dispersed across rural areas of the archipelago, where they largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This caps food poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental shocks. Poverty rates are higher in urban areas, where traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates are high. A former British protectorate, the country became independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years of moderate but sustained economic growth and improvement in social indicators. A low-level conflict between 1998 and 2003, known as 'the tension,' brought the formal economy and many state functions to a halt. Real GDP per capita, which had been slowly eroding between 1996 and 1999, fell sharply between 2000 and 2002. An Australian-led and financed regional peacekeeping mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), stopped the violence and rapidly restored order and basic state functions, particularly in finance. The country has subsequently enjoyed a fairly good security situation, interrupted only by short-lived but destructive riots in 2006, mainly in the capital Honiara. RAMSI presently retains a police and military presence, as well as a large corps of civilians in advisory or in line functions, notably in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT). Given the overall stability in the country, RAMSI will undergo a significant transition in mid-2013. Although an extensive police presence will remain to build the capacity of the Royal Solomon Islands police force, the bulk of the military component is scheduled to depart, and the advisory support will transition to bilateral programs.","Solomon Islands Development Policy Operation-2","2014","2000000"

"Republic of Kenya","The objective of the National Safety Net Programs for Results Project is to support the Republic of Kenya to establish an effective national safety net program for poor and vulnerable households. An essential component of a cash transfer program is a payment mechanism that delivers payments securely to the intended recipients. While the payment mechanisms for the cash transfer programs have improved significantly, the majority of payments are made using a paper-based system with only limited authentication of beneficiaries' identity. This Disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) aimed to gradually increase the use of payment service providers (PSPs) that: (i) make payments electronically, and (ii) use two-factor authentication. The large distances covered by the program combined with severe capacity constraints within the government administration in Northern Kenya has meant that all key areas of the Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP) implementation are subcontracted as follows: a) the administrative component, including targeting, enrollment, registration, and case management, is implemented by a consortium of Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) headed by Oxfam GB; b) the payments component is managed by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust, which in turn sub-contracted Equity Bank to deliver payments to beneficiaries through a network of banking agents; c) the social protection rights component, which is designed to spread awareness of beneficiaries' rights, entitlements and responsibilities and to manage the complaint and grievance mechanism, is implemented by help age international; and d) the monitoring and evaluation component has been implemented by oxford policy management, which collects and analyzes data on a range of process and impact indicators.","National Safety Net Program for Results","2013","250000000"

The new constitution sets the basis for a more open and democratic society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state of law and institutions, and lays the foundation for extended regionalization. These changes have followed on the heels of other reforms already undertaken since the current King came to power. Successive national governments have overseen an impressive political, economic and social transformation, with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s when a series of adverse external shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial crisis. However, as shown, none of these factors provided total immunity to the rising tide of dissatisfaction and to the pressure from the outstanding development issues and challenges.

Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5°C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister.

"Republic of Moldova","The development objective of the Competitiveness Development Policy Operation Program is to improve competitiveness and thereby increase the volume of Moldovan exports, especially in European Union (EU) markets; and improve access to finance thereby promoting investment-led growth. This program document presents a Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO) for an amount of US$30 million. This is a single operation supporting the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Moldova to enhance growth through export competitiveness and increased access to finance. The Government's program for the period 2011-2014 represents a transition from the stabilization and recovery agenda to establishing a strong basis for growth driven by investment, innovation and competitiveness. The operation builds on and deepens the growth and trade-oriented structural reform agenda started under the economic recovery development policy operation, which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 24, 2010. The Government of the Republic of Moldova has an opportunity to implement reforms that would put the economy on a more sustainable export-led growth path. Emerging from the global economic crisis, Moldova's economic growth resumed swiftly in 2010 and 2011; however, the current Euro area crisis is likely to result in a slowdown of growth in 2012 and in the medium term. Moreover, despite the recovery in 2010 and 2011, job creation remained weak. The main driver of growth in 2010-2011 was private consumption, suggesting that the economy could be returning to the pre-crisis pattern of growth. Before the crisis, a decade of growth with weak job creation created a vicious cycle of migration, remittances, exchange rate appreciation, declines in tradable sectors, joblessness, and thus more migration.

The program, to be co-financed by the proposed International Development Association, or IDA operation, will support NTP3 in eight geographically-clustered provinces. In these provinces, a new approach for NTP3 will be tested through the introduction of results-based planning and financing and by strengthening the institutional mechanisms related to governance, procurement, and financial management and environmental and social management systems. The program will therefore seek to progressively transform the NTP into a more focused and efficient system for delivering sustainable investments.","Results-Based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Under the National Target Program","2013","200000000"
"Republic of the Union of Myanmar","The development objective if the National Community Driven Development Project for Myanmar is to enable poor rural communities to benefit from improved access to and use of basic infrastructure and services through a people-centered approach and to enhance the government's capacity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a pre arrears clearance grant in the amount of SDR52.6 million (US$80 million equivalent) to the project. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with an estimated gross domestic product per capita of between US$500-800. While reliable poverty data are scarce in Myanmar, all indicators point to poverty being concentrated in rural areas: two rounds of household surveys (in 2005 and 2009) supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlight significant differences in poverty across geographical areas, with rural poverty considerably higher than urban poverty. Available figures also suggest that social indicators are poor; with for example 32 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, the highest rate in the region. Agriculture is the mainstay of the national economy, generating 43 percent of gross domestic product, 54 percent of employment and providing livelihoods to more that 70 percent of the population. However, the sector is characterized by a number of constraints, including limited irrigation; little value added agro processing capacity, poor policy settings, and widespread indebtedness in rural communities. Fundamental to the triple transition is a 'paradigm shift' to a 'people-centered approach,' as articulated by President Thein Sein. This encompasses greater attention to the delivery of services, a greater proportion of government budget to health and education, and a shift from 'top-down' to 'bottom-up' planning. This shift holds out the promise of change in state-society relations, following a half century of rule by successive military governments. The project will support this paradigm shift and 'people-centered' development by enabling poor rural communities to lead the identification of needs and implementation of activities aimed at promoting access to basic services and rural infrastructure. This will both empower communities and allow the government to deliver visible results of reform at the community level. In addition, the project will engender more constructive relationships between government and communities, and will support rural poverty alleviation, a stated objective of the government's economic reforms. If successful, the project, which will be implemented in 15 of Myanmar's 330 townships, can be scaled up across the country.","Myanmar National Community Driven Development Project","2013","80000000"
"Republic of Tajikistan","The development objective of the Sixth Programmatic Development Policy Grant Program (PDPG6) for Tajikistan is to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The PDPG6 of SDR 13.2 million (US$ 20 million equivalent) is the third in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan. The PDPG4-6 series is central to the World Bank's engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). It supports the government's two-pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and poverty reduction. The series builds on the PDPG1-3 series completed in 2009, and seeks to (i) protect social spending and increase its efficiency, (ii) improve the climate for private sector development, and (iii) strengthen government effectiveness. PDPG4 and PDPG5 focused on protecting earlier social sectors gains, and on improving the environment for private investment. The 2008-09 global economic crisis adversely affected Tajikistan through lower remittances and exports. Growth slowed to 3.9 percent, PDPG6 supports the economic recovery underway following the 2009 slowdown. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has recovered to more than 6 percent in 2010 and 2011. Accordingly, the focus of the PDPG series has shifted from protecting earlier social sector gains to improving the environment for private sector development and strengthening government effectiveness. PDPG6 supports continued implementation of health and education financing reforms and ongoing efforts to improve targeting effectiveness of social assistance. To help spur private sector-led growth, the government has submitted a new law on public private partnerships to Parliament in August 2012, and has continued expedited issuance of land-use certificates to farmers. It has introduced a new salary grid in all central government entities, submitted a new law on public administration to Parliament which was approved in May 2012, approved the chart of accounts for public institutions, and prepared the 2012 budget based on the new budget classification.","Tajikistan PDPG6","2013","20000000"

"United Republic of Tanzania","The development objective of the Urban Local Government Strengthening Program Project for Tanzania is to improve institutional performance for urban service delivery in program urban local government authorities. The growth outlook for Tanzania continues to remain optimistic, although there are certain risks. The economy is estimated to grow by 6.8 percent in 2012, slightly lower than the previous year. The medium term growth outlook remains positive. Achieving a buoyant outlook is dependent on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, structural reforms, and carrying out sound public finance policy and public financial management. However, this remains vulnerable to domestic and external shocks including the Euro zone debt crisis. The level of foreign aid is already projected to decline significantly in FY2012/13. Fiscal consolidation for the central government is on track and is in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy support instrument program. The budget framework for 2012/13 is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), closer to the level before the global financial crisis. The latest debt sustainability analysis (June 2012) shows that Tanzania's risk of debt stress remains low but is sensitive to borrowing terms and the government's fiscal position. Given the uncertainties in the external environment and the public investments through parastatals, Tanzania needs to manage its fiscal and debt sustainability. In 2004, Government of Tanzania (GoT) introduced the Local Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) as a grant flow to local governments. Prior to the introduction of the LGCDG, direct development grants to Local Government Authority (LGAs) were minimal and not performance based. LGAs received certain additional development resources from sectoral development programs and from area-based development programs. The LGCDG has evolved into the Local Government Development Grant (LGDG) program with several sub-programs and has become a mainstream performance based fiscal transfer. By introducing LGDG the government program the Government created a formula-based, transparent and predictable fiscal flow mechanism to disburse funds to all 133 LGAs in the country, on the basis of the institutional performance achieved. The main thrust of the LGDG system is to incentivize the improved institutional performance of LGAs while providing discretionary and sector-specific funding for development purposes. The LGDG system's chief goal is to improve the overall, long-term functioning of the local government system in Tanzania, so as to improve the quality of investments. More specifically, its objectives are to:1) enhance the delivery and management capabilities, productive efficiencies and financial sustainability of local governments; 2) improve access of communities especially the poor, to local services through expanding the physical stock of new and rehabilitated infrastructure; 3) improve the sustainability of local development infrastructure through ensuring proper planning and adequate operations and maintenance (O&M); and 4) provide a national system for the delivery of development grants to LGAs.","Urban Local Government Strengthening Program","2013","255000000"

"United Republic of Tanzania","The development objective of the Accelerated Food Security Project for Tanzania is to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by improving farmers' access to critical agricultural inputs. This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent) to the project. This will be the project's first Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in the country, the improvement of national food security, and the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade. Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the 2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage is critically important in the context of high international fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices. The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on grain production. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the commitment would be defined within the next phase of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the development of this commitment has been postponed to allow for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and performance.

Specifically, the operation will support measures to: (i) improve the efficiency of tax administration; (ii) improve budgetary management, including screening and evaluation of new public investment projects, better estimating costs of new policy initiatives, and strengthening internal controls; and (iii) increase quality and efficiency of the education system, by introducing merit-based selection processes for school managers, annual school-level performance targets, and performance-linked pay, and in the health system by increasing the efficiency of health spending, both in regional hospitals and smaller municipalities.","RIO STATE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN III","2013","300000000"
"Lao People's Democratic Republic","The development objective of the Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 8) Program for Lao PDR is to support policies and institutional reforms that enable the sustainable management of increasing revenues from the natural resource sectors to deliver improved public services. This will enable the country to more effectively translate these revenues into better development outcomes and improved public service delivery. The five policy areas in the new PRSO directly support the strategic objectives of World Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of (i) improving competitiveness and connectivity, (ii) sustainable resource management, (iii) inclusive development, and the crosscutting theme of strategic public sector management. Additionally, this third PRSO series builds on lessons learned from the previous second PSRO series. To ensure impact and results from the previously supported reforms, the third PRSO series continues support in some policy areas while aiming to selectively open new fronts of support for reform to meet the country's development challenges that include diversified and inclusive growth. The preparation of the new PRSO series included extensive consultations with all stakeholders, and close cooperation with the European Commission (EC). This PRSO series arrives at a critical time as Lao PDR's economy benefits from abundant natural resources, which, if managed well, may put the country on a sustainable and inclusive medium-term growth path. Lao PDR's forests, agricultural land, water and mineral resources and hydropower potential account for more than half of the country's total wealth. With appropriate macroeconomic and governance policies, the country's natural resource wealth can contribute significantly towards rapid, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Rapid expansion of the hydropower and mining sectors has benefited the country by contributing towards general economic growth, increasing fiscal revenues significantly, and reducing local poverty and improving infrastructure. It has also promoted change in environmental legislation.","Lao Eight Poverty Reduction Support","2013","20000000"

"Republic of Kenya","The objectives of the National Urban Transport Improvement Project for Kenya are to: (a) improve the efficiency of road transport along the Northern corridor; (b) improve the institutional capacity and arrangements in the urban transport sub-sector; and (c) promote the private sector participation in the operation, financing and management of transport systems. There are three components to the project, the first component being support to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to upgrade the urban road transport infrastructure. This component will involve: constructing and rehabilitating non-motorized transport facilities, including foot paths, cycle tracks, pedestrian bridges and underpasses; and carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering design studies of roads adjoining major towns and studies for improvement of traffic flows through provision of technical advisory services. The second component is the support to Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to develop selected mass transit corridors. The activities under this component of the project, which include carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding and contract documents for works and associated facilities as well as selection of private sector operators to provide large capacity buses for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and rolling stock for a commuter rail system are a precursor for a successor project. Finally, the third component is the institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support and deepen the implementation of reforms in the transport sector with a major focus on urban transport.","KENYA: NATIONAL URBAN TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT","2013","300000000"
