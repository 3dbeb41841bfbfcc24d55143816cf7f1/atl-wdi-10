Tonight's homework is three-fold: 


## Part 1: Carmen Sandiego

This assignment will get you comfortable with queries. 

Follow the [readme.md](carmen-sandiego/README.md) in the carmen-sandiego folder and put your answers in find_carmen.sql (more details in the associated readme).

**Strong Recommendation:** Make finding Carmen Sandiego way more fun and faster by partnering up! Work with at least one other person, ask the evening TA to make a breakout room or make your own Zoom room!

## Part 2: NFL

This assignment will give you more practice with queries, and get
you to deal with some more advanced parts of the sql language. Start this after after having completed Carmen Sandiego.

Follow the [readme.md](nfl/README.md) in the nfl folder and put your answers in nfl.sql (more details in the associated readme).

## Part 3: Realty

This assignment will expose you to modeling your data, and manually
creating tables and seeding your database.

Follow the [readme.md](realty/README.md) in the realty folder and put your answers in realty_schema.sql, realty_seed.sql and realty.sql (more details in the associated readme)
