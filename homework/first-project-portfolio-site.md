## Start building your portfolio site!
- Make it as unique as you'd like! We'll keep working on 
these throughout the cohort, so don't worry about building 
the entire thing this weekend.
- Your portfolio should contain (at least):
    - Your name
    - A short "About Me" section with some information about you 
    and your career goals.
    - Links to projects that you have completed
    - Links to your Github, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
    
- Post a link to a GitHub Pages or Bitballoon link to the Slack thread in #atl-wdi9-hmwork
