# Angular $http

### Objectives

- Use $http to access an API resource, rather than use hard-coded data

### Preparation

- Be able to start up a Node.js app
- Be able to create an Angular app with controllers
- Understand AJAX and RESTful routing

## Intro (10 mins)

We've only been working with hardcoded data so far. Today that changes, it's time to kick it up a notch.

We're going to learn a little about two different functionalities in Angular that will allow us to start communicating with real data, accessed through an API. You'll need to dust off your knowledge of RESTful routes & AJAX, but hopefully that's a good thing.

Now, since we're going to be interacting with an API, in an ideal world we'd force you to write one first. You totally could. But _because_ you could, and because we'd rather skip to the new stuff, let's use a pre-built backend for this lesson.

We want to make it fast, so we've already made you a sweet little Node API.

Now, real quick – we might want a little seed data. 

- `node config/seeds.js`

```json
[
  {"name": "George Washington", "start": 1789, "end": 1797 },
  {"name": "John Adams", "start": 1797, "end": 1801 },
  {"name": "Thomas Jefferson", "start": 1801, "end": 1809 },
  {"name": "James Madison", "start": 1809, "end": 1817 }
]
```



Once you have some, do a quick `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/presidents` and make sure you've got some JSON.

Take a minute and make some POST requests in CURL or whatever you like to add some presidents to our database.


## Demo of Starter Code (5 mins)

1. `git pull upstream master` to grab the starter code from today's student labs folder. 
1. `cd` into the folder. `npm install` and fire up your server with `nodemon server.js`
2. `node config/seeds.js`


##### &#x1F535; YOU DO - Set up your workspace

Okay, so we've included a bunch of starter code that looks quite a bit like the code you've already written. There's a controller, with some hard-coded data, listing out some of the Presidents in the United States. Hopefully [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States) is accurate, 'cuz who knows stuff like that off the top of their head?

It's our job to mush together this little API we have, and our Angular application.

We'll do this with two different methods, and this one is the first. The next will be in the next lesson.

## Hitting an API with `$http` - Codealong (30 mins)

The simplest starting point will be to switch our hardcoded array of presidents with the one living in our new API.

Step one – **let's delete our hard-coded data.** In `presidentsController.js`:

```js
angular.module('ThePresidentsApp', [])
  .controller('PresidentsController', PresidentsController);

function PresidentsController(){
-  this.all = [
-    {name: 'George Washington', start: 1789, end: 1797 },
-    {name: 'John Adams', start: 1797, end: 1801 },
-    {name: 'Thomas Jefferson', start: 1801, end: 1809 },
-    {name: 'James Madison', start: 1809, end: 1817 }
-  ]
+  this.all = [];
}
```

With a little setup, we'll do a GET request to our API, and assign `this.all` to the array we get back. To do that, we're going to have to use an Angular library called `$http`.

### Injecting Dependencies

Angular dependencies – like libraries or plugins that other people have built – are defined first in our module (unless they come with Angular by default), and then _injected_ into any controllers that need to use them.

`$http` happens to come with Angular, so we only need to _inject_ it into our controller. We do that with a simple command, and then by simply passing an argument to our controller function.

In `js/presidentsController.js`:

```js
PresidentsController.$inject = ['$http'];
function PresidentsController($http){
  // ...
```

The first tells the controller we intend to use this library called `$http`, the second allows us to pass the library in and gives it the name $http. Think of it just like any other argument in a function – because it's the first argument, and we called it $http, we can use it inside our function using that name.

***note:***

The $inject method additionally protects from reference loss caused by minification. Woo!

### Using $http is just AJAX!

`$http` is not very different than how we've used AJAX in the past, especially with JQuery. Let's see it all, then walk through it. In `js/presidentsController.js` again:

```js
PresidentsController.$inject = ['$http'];

function PresidentsController($http){
  var self = this;
  self.all = [];

  function getPresidents(){
    $http
      .get('/presidents')
      .then(function(response){
        self.all = response.data.presidents;
    });
  }

  getPresidents();

// ...
}
```

There are a few important things to note. Let's cut it down first just to $http:

```js
function PresidentsController($http){
// ...

  function getPresidents(){
    $http
      .get('/presidents')
      .then(function(response){
        self.all = response.data.presidents;
    });
  }

  getPresidents();

// ...
}
```

We call `$http`, then our favorite HTTP verb, `.get`. There's one for `.post`, too. What's returned from our asynchronous call is a unique object called a promise. A promise can have three states: pending, fulfilled or rejected. We use `.then()` (a method inherent to a promise object) to capture the callback when it's _done_ and the state is either fulfilled or rejected.  Then, we can pass `.then()` a function to overwrite our `.all` array with the response we get back.

Feel free to `console.log(response)` and see everything that comes back. `.data` is just the data, `.presidents` is the key inside our JSON holding an array of presidents.

That's all we're doing in that function. Afterwords, we literally just run the function, which runs when we first load up the app. Easy.

**Now before we move on and you try it yourself, there's an important detail to note.** We've suddenly gone from:

```js
function PresidentsController($http){
  this.all = [];
  // ...
```

to

```js
function PresidentsController($http){
  var self = this;
  self.all = [];
  // ...
```

**Why?** The answer is JavaScript's _scope_. As you've seen in the past few weeks, `this` means different things depending on how many layers deep your code is.

In the previous example, which function is `this` scoped to?

```js
function PresidentsController($http){
// ...

  function getPresidents(){
    $http
      .get('/presidents')
      .then(function(response){
        // Where is 'this' scoped to?
        this.all = response.data.presidents;
    });
  }
// ...
}
```

We're 3 functions deep when we call `this.all` – `this` is no longer referring to our controller, it's referring to the function inside `.then`. If you left it that way, you'd never see any data, because to see it in the view, that data needs to be attached directly to our _controller_.

So what's a simple way to make sure we're scoped to the right place? A tiny little variable. The variable you choose is up to you, it's just preference. So if we do:

```js
function PresidentsController($http){
  var self = this;
  self.all = [];
// ...

  function getPresidents(){
    $http
      .get('/presidents')
      .then(function(response){
        self.all = response.data.presidents;
    });
  }

  getPresidents();

// ...
}
```

Now we can trust we're talking to the right scope.

Try refreshing your browser, let's see if it worked!

## Independent Practice (20 minutes)

Now that we've got GETing down, it's up to you to try POSTing and DELETING. Just like any RESTful API, you can add a new president by POSTing to the correct URL. You'll need to modify your controller action to send a new president from the form to our API, and probably look up the Angular documentation to figure out how to do it.



## Conclusion (5 mins)
- How do you inject dependencies into an Angular controller?
- How do you use $http to do a GET request?
- Why did we start using `self` instead of `this`?
- How do you do a POST request?
