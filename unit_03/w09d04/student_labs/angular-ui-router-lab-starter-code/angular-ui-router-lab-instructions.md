# Front-end Routing with UI-Router

## Introduction

To practice working with UI-Router, you're going to make a single-page app with multiple views. Rather than starting totally from scratch, you'll be build up our previous **Infamous Criminals** interface to be more like a _real_ app.  Your mission is to convert the `starter-code` so that each section of the interface has one purpose – one page per function. To get set-up...
   
- Make sure you've got Mongo running (`mongod`) in a separate terminal tab.
- Navigate to the `starter_code` folder, and fire that up with a `nodemon app.js`


## Exercise

Your app should have:

- A list page, listing all our criminals
- An about page, explaining what this application is for
- A new page, to add a new criminal

#### Starter Code

In your starter folder you'll find a complete **Infamous Criminals** interface, but only on one page.

#### Deliverable

An Angular application with multiple states using UI-Router.
