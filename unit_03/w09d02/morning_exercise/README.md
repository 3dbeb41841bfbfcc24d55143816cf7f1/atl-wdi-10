# Stopwatch 3000

This morning you will be writing the Javascript that turns some CSS into a working, fully functioning jQuery stopwatch! Why purchase a stopwatch when you can just code one? Good point, let's hop to it..

## Setup
- All your files are set up:
  - index.html (do not modify)
  - styles

- Take a look at your html so you can select and modify elements.

## EXERCISES
- You will be writing your code in `js/script.js`.
- use jQuery click events so that clicking on:
  - START: starts the clock, and increments by 1 integer every second
  - STOP: stops the clock
  - RESET: turns the display back to 0
  - COUNTDOWN: starts the clock, but decrements by 1 integer every second

### Tips:
- For timing effects you can use [setInterval](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)
- Console log your variables
- Have some kind of plan (..pseudocode?)

### Reach Goals:
- Display seconds and milliseconds
- Change COUNTDOWN's functionality so that it logs "lap times". For each time you click it, it will append a new paragraph that displays the amount of time elapsed since the last click.
